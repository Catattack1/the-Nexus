To Whom It May Concern,

The remnants of a recently destroyed and now deserted village lie waiting for those with the courage and cunning to seize their opportunities. Within the ruins, treasures and valuables are surely hidden amidst the chaos. I require a select group of individuals to seek out and gather these items of worth.

You will deliver all that you find to the designated location by the next full moon. Ensure your actions are swift and discreet. In return, you will be handsomely rewarded for your services.

Do not attempt to deceive me. My eyes are everywhere, and I tolerate no betrayal.

Sign your work with efficiency and secrecy,

M
