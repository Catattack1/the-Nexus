**Magic Item Properties:**

- The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dusk.
- **Spellcasting:** While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: _Animate Dead_ (1 charge), _Blindness/Deafness_ (2 charges), _Circle of Death_ (6 charges), _Finger of Death_ (7 charges), _Wave of Enfeeblement_ (2 charges), no components required.
- **Aura of Desecration:** As an action, you can expend 3 charges to create an aura in a 30-foot radius around you for 10 minutes. All undead within the aura have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. All healing spells cast within the aura are halved in effectiveness.
- **Command Undead:** By using an action and expending 5 charges, you can target one undead creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or fall under your control, following your verbal commands to the best of its ability. The effect ends after 24 hours.
- **Reaperâ€™s Call:** Expending 10 charges, you can perform a 1-minute ritual to summon and control a Specter (see the Monster Manual for stats), which remains for 1 hour, obeys your commands, and can't be turned or controlled by other means.
