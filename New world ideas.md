A new world ruled by four governments one government should be a dictatorship or should I should be a monarchy and then a democratically elected presidency and a council state the world itself should be a pangea style continent with large rivers where the planet is mostly water and the four kingdoms have divided the pangea into their own respective domains where they rule with varying and very different laws the only commonality is the vast majority of people can't travel freely between each country because of high tensions every few people that can or some types of merchants and adventurous of high ranks the main campaign idea would be that the players are heroes summon heroes who were originally ordinary people the summit heroes must navigate the world and stop oncoming waves the summoned heroes have some special privileges over other people and they have these specialized gauntlet that allows them to analyze materials and understand all languages and also to be understood by all as a part of the feature of this gauntlet it can absorb the materials of anything they play or desires to put into it and they can potentially gain different things from that rather it would be a random stat boost or a new ability the main thing introduced for this campaign would be a new system called special abilities which would be not directly linked with their class but still influenced by it other than that I should also dictate the main currency system is gold silver copper electrum and platinum and a world economy is set in place to some degree other than that the players will have to find a housing and other situational things such as gear upgrades and either purchase or find them themselves or get them from a random quest the players can either go to guilds or receive special requests from individuals and this world works on logic not to it is similarly from rising of The shield hero so yes you can use a slave crest on people and creatures and demi-humans are in existence so feel free to find a few and call them your allies this has been a brief overview of my campaign idea sincerely Neko
