# Arcanavist Spellcrafting Rules (Prototype Spell System)

This system governs the creation, casting, and cost of **Prototype Spells** for the Arcanavist class. Instead of learning predefined spells, Arcanavists craft custom spells using modular components called **Spell Parts**.

---

## Core Mechanics

### Spell Complexity

Every Prototype Spell has a **Complexity Score**, calculated by adding together the values of the selected **Spell Parts**, then adding a **base Complexity of 5**.

**Complexity = 5 + Total of Spell Part Values**

The spell's Complexity determines both:

- The **DC** of an Intelligence (Arcana) check required to successfully cast it
    
- The **spell slot level** required to cast it
    

---

### Spellcasting Check

To cast a Prototype Spell, make an **Intelligence check** using your spellcasting modifier.

- **DC = Spell’s Complexity Score**
    
- On a **success**, the spell is cast as intended
    
- On a **failure**, the spell fizzles, misfires, or produces an unintended effect (DM's discretion)
    

You can cast a number of Prototype Spells per long rest equal to your **Intelligence modifier (minimum 1)**. Spell slots are still expended on failure.

## Spell Slots by Complexity

| Complexity Score | Slot Level Required                |     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | --- |
| 5–7              | 1st-level                          |     |
| 8–9              | 2nd-level                          |     |

| 12–13            | 4th-level                          |     |
| 14–15            | 5th-level                          |     |
| 16–17            | 6th-level                          |     |

| 22–23            | 9th-level                          |     |
| 24+              | Cannot be cast with standard slots |     |

## Spell Parts

When creating a Prototype Spell, select one option from each of the following categories. Each part adds a specific value to the spell’s Complexity Score.

### Shape

| ------------------- | ---------- |
| Self                | 0          |
| Touch               | 1          |

| 60 ft Line          | 3          |
| 15 ft Cone          | 2          |

### Duration

| Duration                | Complexity      |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Instant                 | 0               |
| Concentration ≤ 1 min   | 1               |
| Concentration ≤ 10 min  | 2               |
| Up to 1 hour            | 3               |
| Over 1 hour             | 4               |
| Permanent (ritual only) | 6 (DM approval) |


### Range

Each effect has a **default range** based on its type. You can increase this range by adding Complexity.

|Range Increase|Added Complexity|
|---|---|
|+30 ft|+1|
|+60 ft|+2|
|+120 ft|+3|
|Sight (line of sight)|+4|
|Unlimited (same plane)|+5 (DM approval)|

Example: A damage spell with a default 60 ft range extended to 120 ft would add +2 Complexity.
