### Corpse Explosion

**School:** Necromancy  
**Level:** 1  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous or up to 1 minute (see below)

**Description:**  
You infuse a corpse within range with a potent burst of necrotic energy, causing it to explode either instantly or at a point of your choosing within the spell's duration. When you cast this spell, or as a bonus action on a turn before the spell ends, you can cause the corpse to detonate.

When the corpse explodes, it deals 2d8 necrotic damage to all creatures within a 15-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes full damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The explosion destroys the corpse, which can't be used as a component for this spell again.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st, and the radius of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every two slot levels above 1st.


1. **Chill of the Grave**:
    
    - **Effect**: You send a cold shiver from the realm of the dead towards a creature you can see within range. The target feels an unnerving chill, granting you advantage on your next Intimidation check against it within the next minute.
    - **Utility**: Useful for social manipulation or interrogation, embodying the necromancer's eerie presence.
2. **Withering Touch**:
    
    - **Effect**: Your touch saps the life energy from a creature, causing a minor necrotic injury. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 necrotic damage, and its healing received is reduced by 1 point until the end of your next turn.
    - **Utility**: Weakens an enemy's ability to recover, useful for wearing down opponents over time.
3. **Shadow Veil**:
    
    - **Effect**: You cloak a small object or area within 5 feet in shadows, making it harder to see. For the next minute, any Perception checks made to see the cloaked object or area are made with disadvantage.
    - **Utility**: Good for hiding traps, objects, or even casting in dim light to create an area of deeper shadow for stealth purposes.
4. **Spectral Whisper**:
    
    - **Effect**: You whisper a message to a single creature within range, using the voices of the dead. Only the target hears the message, and it can whisper back a reply that you hear. The message can be no more than 25 words.
    - **Utility**: Allows for discreet communication or intimidation, with a range that's useful in both social and combat scenarios.
5. **Necrotic Spark**:
    
    - **Effect**: You flick your wrist, sending a small spark of necrotic energy to a point you choose within range. The spark is visible and can ignite flammable objects not being worn or carried.
    - **Utility**: Useful for distraction, signaling, or igniting flammable traps or barriers.
6. **Bone Meld**:
    
    - **Effect**: You touch a bone fragment and a small object (no larger than 1 cubic foot), temporarily fusing them together. The object takes on a slightly eerie appearance, and the bond lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as an action.
    - **Utility**: Can be used to hide small items, create makeshift tools or weapons, or simply for aesthetic purposes.
7. **Graveyard Fog**:
    
    - **Effect**: You create a small puff of dense, cold fog that spreads out from a point you choose within range. The fog obscures vision in a 5-foot-radius sphere until the end of your next turn.
    - **Utility**: Briefly hides movements, creates a momentary distraction, or can be used to unsettle opponents with a sudden manifestation of grave-like cold.
8. **Death's Beacon**:
    
    - **Effect**: You cause a corpse or skeleton within range to emit a faint, ghostly glow for 1 minute. The light is dim and only illuminates a 5-foot radius, but it can be seen through fog, smoke, and similar obstructions.
    - **Utility**: Marks a location or object of interest, or can be used to create an eerie warning or signal.
