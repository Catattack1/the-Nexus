### Hunger Mechanics Overview

#### 1. Daily Food Requirements

- **Basic Requirement:** Characters need to consume a certain amount of food per day to avoid hunger. A standard measurement is one pound of food per day for a Medium creature. Small creatures need half as much, while Large creatures need twice the amount.

#### 2. Stages of Hunger

If a character does not meet their daily food requirement, they progress through stages of hunger, each with increasing penalties. Here’s a suggestion for structuring these stages:

- **Satisfied:** No penalties. The character has eaten their daily requirement.
- **Hungry (after 1 day without food):** Disadvantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. The character can push this stage for 3 + Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) days before moving to the next stage.
- **Starving (after exceeding Hungry stage limit):** Disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The character loses hit points equal to their level each day at this stage until they eat or reach 0 hit points, at which point they fall unconscious and must make death saving throws as per the standard rules.
- **Recovery:** Eating the daily food requirement while Starving stops the loss of hit points but does not immediately remove the disadvantages. A full day of being Satisfied is required to return to normal status.

#### 3. Foraging and Hunting

Foraging and hunting become critical activities for characters to meet their food requirements. Use the rules for foraging in the Dungeon Master’s Guide, adjusting the difficulty based on the environment. Successful foraging or hunting can prevent or delay the onset of hunger stages.

#### 4. Food Preservation and Scarcity

Consider introducing elements of food preservation and scarcity. Characters can attempt to preserve food, but this may require specific skills or materials. Scarcity can vary based on location, season, and the campaign's narrative, adding an extra layer of challenge.

#### 5. Implementing the Hunger Mechanic

- **Track Food Consumption:** Players and the DM should keep track of food supplies and daily consumption. This can be as detailed or as simplified as suits the campaign style.
- **Narrative Opportunities:** Use the hunger mechanic to create narrative and role-playing opportunities. Scarcity can lead to moral dilemmas, quests for food resources, and interactions with local populations.
- **Adjustments for Gameplay:** Be prepared to adjust the harshness of the hunger mechanic based on player feedback and the desired difficulty level of the campaign. The goal is to add tension and challenge without detracting from the overall enjoyment of the game.
