### Finalized System Overview

#### 1. Time Allocation Framework

- **Day Length:** 24 hours.
- **Rest Requirements:** 8 hours for a long rest, 1 hour for a short rest.
- **Activity Time Slots:** Players can allocate their remaining 15 hours (after accounting for a long rest) to various activities, including travel, exploration, foraging, hunting, crafting, and resting.

#### 2. Flexible Time Allocation for Activities

Players must declare at the beginning of the day (in-game time) how they plan to spend their hours. This plan includes specifying how much time they'll dedicate to each activity. The DM tracks time spent and adjusts the game's progress accordingly.

#### 3. Bonus System for Activities

- **Foraging, Hunting, Searching:** For every hour spent on these activities, players receive a +1 bonus to their skill checks, up to a maximum of +5. After reaching the maximum bonus, each additional hour provides a half bonus (+0.5) due to diminishing returns.
- **Crafting/Repairing:** Additional time spent can improve the quality or success rate. For every 2 hours spent beyond the minimum required time, players receive a +1 bonus to their check, up to a maximum bonus determined by the DM based on the complexity of the task.
- **Resting:** Adequate rest is crucial. Failure to rest sufficiently can result in exhaustion levels as per standard D&D 5e rules.

#### 4. Implementation in Gameplay

- **Planning Phase:** At the start of each day, the party discusses their objectives and how they wish to allocate their time among the available activities.
- **Action Phase:** The DM describes the outcomes of the players' actions, incorporating the time-based bonuses into skill checks and narrating the consequences of those activities, including encounters or discoveries.
- **Review Phase:** At the end of the day (in-game time), review the outcomes, including any resources gathered, information found, or progress made toward their goals. Also, discuss the impact of their decisions on their physical and mental state, considering the need for rest and recovery.

#### 5. Consequences and Rewards

- **Successful Activities:** Successful foraging, hunting, or searching can yield resources crucial for survival. The more time dedicated, the greater the potential rewards, reflecting the players' efforts and strategic time management.
- **Overexertion Penalties:** Players who neglect rest or push themselves too hard can face exhaustion penalties, impacting their abilities and effectiveness in combat and other activities.

#### 6. Integration with D&D Mechanics

- This system dovetails with existing D&D mechanics through skill checks, exhaustion rules, and the crafting system. It adds a layer of strategic resource management without needing extensive modifications to the core rules.
- The DM has the flexibility to adjust difficulty, bonuses, and outcomes based on the campaign's needs, ensuring that the system enhances the survival experience without overwhelming the players with complexity.

### Sleep Management Mechanics

#### 1. Basic Sleep Requirements

- **Long Rest:** Characters require 8 hours of sleep per 24-hour period to avoid negative effects.
- **Short Rest:** While not a substitute for sleep, short rests can help characters recover some abilities and hit points.

#### 2. Penalties for Skipping Sleep

If characters do not meet their sleep requirements, they suffer penalties due to fatigue and exhaustion. Here's a structured approach:

- **After 24 Hours Without Sleep:** Characters must make a Constitution saving throw to avoid the effects of exhaustion. The DC starts at 10 and increases by 5 for each subsequent 24-hour period without sleep.
    
    - **Failure:** The character gains one level of exhaustion.
    - **Success:** The character avoids gaining exhaustion but cannot benefit from this success indefinitely. After three successful saves, the character automatically gains one level of exhaustion for each subsequent 24-hour period without sleep, regardless of saving throw outcomes.

#### 3. Levels of Exhaustion

The exhaustion levels caused by lack of sleep follow the standard D&D 5e exhaustion mechanics:

- **Level 1:** Disadvantage on ability checks
- **Level 2:** Speed halved
- **Level 3:** Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
- **Level 4:** Hit point maximum halved
- **Level 5:** Speed reduced to 0
- **Level 6:** Death

#### 4. Recovering from Exhaustion

- **One Long Rest:** Reduces exhaustion by one level. Must include proper sleep in a safe environment.
- **Magic:** Certain spells and abilities can reduce or eliminate exhaustion levels but should be used judiciously to maintain the campaign's survival challenge.
