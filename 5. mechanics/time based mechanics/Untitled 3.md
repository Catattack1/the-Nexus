as i continue going through the woods i stumble across a lone wolf which wipe before it spots me i quickly get on all fours and cast an illusion spell that should make me appear as a healthy female wolf this does make him friendly to me but unfortunately the smells my body is producing makes me incredibly tempting as a mate and i can't move too far or fast or it might break the spell
