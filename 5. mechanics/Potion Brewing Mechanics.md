### Detailed Potion Brewing Mechanics

1. **Brewing Apparatus**: Introduce different types of brewing equipment, like cauldrons, alembics, and brewing stands. Each type could have unique properties or be suited to specific kinds of potions.
    
2. **Temperature Management**:
    
    - Players must heat their brewing apparatus to a specific temperature range suitable for the potion they're crafting.
    - Temperature could be controlled through magical means or physical methods like fire intensity.
    - Incorrect temperature may result in a failed brew or unexpected effects.
3. **Ingredient Order and Timing**:
    
    - Each potion recipe requires ingredients to be added in a specific order.
    - Certain ingredients might need to be pre-processed (e.g., ground into powder, soaked overnight).
    - After adding some ingredients, the potion must rest or simmer for a set period before the next ingredient can be added.
4. **Skill Checks**:
    
    - Players perform skill checks for different stages of the brewing process (e.g., correctly heating the apparatus, adding ingredients at the right time).
    - The difficulty of these checks can vary based on the potion's complexity and the player's proficiency with brewing tools.
    - Success or failure in these checks can affect the quality and potency of the final potion.
5. **Failed Brews**:
    
    - If the procedure is not followed correctly, the potion could fail, resulting in a useless or inert concoction.
    - Optionally, failed potions could have minor, unintended side effects to add an element of unpredictability.
6. **Record Keeping and Learning Curve**:
    
    - Players should keep track of the steps they take when brewing, learning from both successes and failures.
    - Over time, they can become more proficient, reducing the difficulty of skill checks for familiar potions.
7. **Resource Management**:
    
    - Fuel for maintaining the temperature, like wood, coal, or magical energy, becomes an additional resource for players to manage.
    - Some rare or powerful potions might require rare fuels to reach the necessary temperatures.

### Example Potion Brewing Scenario

- **Potion of Night Vision**:
    1. **Base Potion**: Start with a Water Bottle heated to a mild simmer.
    2. **First Ingredient**: Add Nether Wart and let the mixture rest for 5 minutes.
    3. **Temperature Adjustment**: Increase the heat to bring the mixture to a boil.
    4. **Second Ingredient**: Carefully add Golden Carrot after the mixture has boiled for 2 minutes.
    5. **Rest Period**: Let the potion simmer for another 10 minutes.
    6. **Skill Check**: Conduct an Alchemy skill check to determine the potion's effectiveness.
    7. **Final Potion**: If successful, the potion grants night vision for a duration based on the skill check's outcome.
### 1. Potion of Invisibility

- **Base Potion**: Start with a Clearwater base kept at room temperature.
- **First Ingredient**: Dissolve "Moonshade Petals" into the water.
- **Skill Check**: Stealth (DC 14) to handle the petals delicately without disturbing their essence.
- **Second Ingredient**: Add "Chameleon Scales" while the potion is stirred slowly.
- **Skill Check**: Sleight of Hand (DC 16) to evenly distribute the scales.
- **Final Step**: Expose the potion to moonlight for an hour.
- **Result**: Grants invisibility for up to 30 minutes, but any aggressive action breaks the effect.
### Expanded Ingredients List

1. **Ethereal Blossom**:
    
    - **Effect**: Used to brew potions that affect the mind, such as memory enhancement or inducing calm.
    - **Pre-Processing**: Must be dried under the light of a full moon.
2. **Phoenix Feather**:
    
    - **Effect**: Imparts rejuvenation properties, crucial for healing potions or those that grant temporary boosts to physical abilities.
    - **Pre-Processing**: Needs to be finely ground in a mortar enchanted with fire magic.
3. **Dragon's Blood Resin**:
    
    - **Effect**: Enhances the potency of potions, making effects last longer or more intense.
    - **Pre-Processing**: Must be melted and mixed with a drop of the brewerâ€™s blood for personalization.
4. **Silverweed Roots**:
    
    - **Effect**: Used in potions that allow for shape-shifting or temporary invisibility.
    - **Pre-Processing**: Roots should be soaked in a potion of clarity for one night to remove impurities.
5. **Starfallen Ore**:
    
    - **Effect**: Grants magical resistance or boosts spellcasting abilities for a short duration.
    - **Pre-Processing**: Ore must be powdered using a pestle and mortar made of the same material.
6. **Aetherial Dust**:
    
    - **Effect**: Introduces an element of randomness, can amplify or mutate the potion's intended effects in unpredictable ways.
    - **Pre-Processing**: No processing needed, but must be handled with utmost care to avoid unintentional dispersal.

### Additional Brewing Mechanics

1. **Magical Contamination**:
    
    - Players must ensure their brewing area is free from unwanted magical energies which could alter the potion's effects.
    - Regular cleansing rituals or protective wards could be necessary to maintain a pure environment.
2. **Alignment with Celestial Bodies**:
    
    - Some potions might require brewing or ingredients to be prepared under specific celestial alignments for maximum efficacy.
    - Tracking celestial movements becomes a critical skill for advanced potion-making.
3. **Ingredient Compatibility**:
    
    - Not all ingredients work well together; combining incompatible elements could lead to dangerous reactions.
    - Players need to learn through experimentation or ancient texts which combinations are safe and effective.
4. **Use of Personal Items**:
    
    - Incorporating personal items (e.g., hair, blood) can tailor potions to individuals, enhancing or altering their effects significantly.
5. **Enchanted Utensils**:
    
    - Using tools enchanted with specific properties (e.g., a stirring rod that cools or heats the potion) can introduce unique effects or ease the brewing process.

### Example Potion Brewing Scenario: Potion of Boundless Energy

- **First Ingredient**: Stir in ground Phoenix Feather slowly, ensuring complete dissolution.
- **Temperature Adjustment**: Lower the heat to a gentle simmer.
- **Second Ingredient**: Add powdered Starfallen Ore while chanting an incantation of power.
- **Skill Check**: Arcana (DC 18) to imbue the potion with magical energy without overwhelming it.
- **Rest Period**: Allow the potion to cool under the light of a crescent moon for optimal magical infusion.
- **Final Step**: Bottle the potion with a talisman of vigor affixed to the container.
