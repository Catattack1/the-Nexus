### Basic Concept

- **Mana Points (MP)**: Each character has a pool of Mana Points representing their magical energy. The size of this pool could be determined by factors like character level, class, intelligence, wisdom, or a specific magic-related ability score.
- **Ancient Language Casting**: Characters can cast spells by speaking phrases in the ancient language. The power and complexity of the spell depend on the number of words used.
  ### Spell Difficulty

- **Basic (1-3 Words)**: Simple effects, low mana cost. (e.g., light, minor healing)
- **Intermediate (4-6 Words)**: More complex or powerful effects. (e.g., stronger attacks, moderate healing)
- **Advanced (7-10 Words)**: Very powerful or intricate effects. High mana cost and possibly additional requirements (like rare components or extra casting time).
  ### Safety Mechanisms

- **Mispronunciation Risks**: Incorrectly spoken phrases might lead to spell failure or unintended effects.
- **Mana Depletion**: Using too much mana could lead to exhaustion or other negative effects.
  ### Integration with D&D Mechanics

- **Ability Checks**: For difficult spells or under pressure, require an Arcana check, Intelligence check, or a new skill check related to the ancient language.
- **Spell Resistance and Saving Throws**: Use standard D&D mechanics for resisting spells or avoiding effects.
### Example Spell Phrase

- **Phrase**: "Aiedail Ganga Edur" (Translation: "Morning Star Flow Water")
- **Effect**: Creates a stream of luminous water that can both illuminate and extinguish fires.
- **Mana Cost**: 3 MP (1 MP per word)

### Spell Difficulty

1. **Basic Spells (1-3 Words)**:
    
    - **Effects**: Light, minor healing, small telekinetic actions, simple elemental manipulations.
    - **Mana Cost**: Low, 1-3 MP.

### 1. Introduction to Arcane Linguistics

**Arcane Linguistics** is an Intelligence-based skill that represents a character's proficiency in the ancient magical language, focusing on the nuanced manipulation of its words to alter spell effects. Characters can become proficient in this skill through their background, class features, or training.

### 2. Spell Modification Mechanics

#### a. Intensity Modifier

- **Description**: Increases a spell's power or magnitude.
- **Mechanic**: Additional Mana Points (MP) can be allocated to enhance a spell's damage, healing, or other quantifiable effects. No initial check is required for basic enhancement, but for significant amplifications, an Arcane Linguistics check may be needed.
- **Example**: Enhancing a "Fireball" spell to deal additional damage.

#### b. Speed Modifier

- **Description**: Alters the casting time of a spell.
- **Mechanic**: An (Intelligence) Arcane Linguistics check is required to cast a spell more quickly or to extend its duration. Success allows the spell to be cast with the desired modification.
- **DC Formula**: Base DC of 10 + 2 for each word in the spell.
- **Example**: Quickening a healing spell to act as a bonus action.

#### c. Range Modifier

- **Description**: Adjusts the range of a spell.
- **Mechanic**: An (Intelligence) Arcane Linguistics check is necessary to modify a spell's range. The complexity of the modification reflects in the DC.
- **DC Formula**: Base DC of 12 + 2 for each word in the spell.
- **Example**: Extending the reach of a "Lightning Bolt".

#### d. Modified Spell (Effects, Area, Duration)

- **Description**: Changes spell effects, area of impact, or duration.
- **Mechanic**: Requires an (Intelligence) Arcane Linguistics check to apply complex modifications.
- **DC Formula**: Base DC of 14 + 2 for each word in the spell.
- **Example**: Altering a "Fog Cloud" spell to also chill enemies within it.

### 3. Difficulty Class (DC) Scaling

The DC for each type of modification scales with the number of words in the spell, reflecting the increased complexity and energy required for more sophisticated spells.

- **Base DCs**:
    - **Quickened Spell**: Base DC of 10.
    - **Range Modifier**: Base DC of 12.
    - **Modified Spell**: Base DC of 14.
- **Scaling**: +2 DC for each word in the spell.

### 4. Implementing Spell Modifications in Gameplay

- **Skill Checks**: Use the Arcane Linguistics skill for all modification checks, emphasizing the character's knowledge and expertise.
- **Mana Point Adjustments**: Spell modifications affect the MP cost, requiring strategic resource management.
- **Character Progression**: Proficiency and improvement in Arcane Linguistics can unlock more potent and complex spell modifications.
- **Balancing**: Adjust DCs and effects based on campaign balance, ensuring modifications are powerful but not game-breaking.
- **Creativity and Strategy**: Reward innovative use of spell modifications that enhance gameplay and storytelling.

### 5. Examples

- **Quickened 4-Word Spell**: Casting a 4-word spell as a quick action has a DC of 18 (10 + 2*4).
- **Range Extended 5-Word Spell**: Modifying the range of a 5-word spell has a DC of 22 (12 + 2*5).
- **Effect Modified 3-Word Spell**: Changing the effect of a 3-word spell has a DC of 20 (14 + 2*3).

### 6. Additional Guidelines

- **DM Discretion**: The Dungeon Master has the final say on the feasibility and outcomes of spell modifications.
- **Creative Encouragement**: Players are encouraged to explore the possibilities within the magic system, with rewards for clever and effective uses.
- **Continuous Adjustment**: The system should be flexible, with adjustments made based on gameplay experience to maintain balance and enjoyment.

- ### Speed Modifier
  - a player can choose to make a (intelligence)Arcane Linguistics check to speak the phrase and cast the spell as a bonus action instead of an action.
  -  **DC Formula**: Base DC of 10 + 2 for each word in the spell.
