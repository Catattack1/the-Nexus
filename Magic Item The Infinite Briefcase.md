### Magic Item: The Infinite Briefcase

**Category:** Wondrous Item  
**Rarity:** Rare  
**Attunement:** Yes

**Description:** The Infinite Briefcase appears to be a well-made, albeit ordinary, leather briefcase at first glance. Upon opening, it reveals an interior that doesn't quite match its outer dimensions, hinting at the space within being far more expansive. This briefcase has been enchanted with a unique form of pocket dimension magic, allowing the user to reach in and pull out any mundane item they can clearly envision, as long as it would fit through the opening of the briefcase.

The interior of the briefcase is a marvel of magical engineering, acting as a gateway to a small, but infinitely deep, pocket dimension. This dimension is filled with an endless assortment of mundane items, collected from various points in time and space.

**Charges:** The Infinite Briefcase has 10 charges. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Using the Briefcase:** To use the briefcase, the wielder must hold it open, envision the item they wish to retrieve, and reach into the briefcase. The desired item will come to hand if the wielder expends the appropriate number of charges:

- **Small items (tools, keys, books):** 1 charge
- **Medium items (weapons, shields, clothing):** 2 charges
- **Large items (chairs, ladders, large musical instruments):** 3 charges

Items larger than what could traditionally fit in a standard briefcase are beyond the briefcase's capability to provide.

**Limitations:** The briefcase cannot produce magical items, living creatures, or anything with intrinsic magical properties (including potions). Additionally, the item must be specific and well-known to the wielder; vague or unknown items cannot be summoned.

**Optional Rule - Unpredictability:** The DM may choose to add an element of unpredictability when using the briefcase. When a user pulls an item from the briefcase, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the briefcase produces a similar but unexpected item (DM's choice), which may or may not be useful in the situation.
