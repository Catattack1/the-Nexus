Tucked away in a forgotten drawer within the lighthouse's cozy, weather-beaten interior, you discover an envelope, its paper yellowed and edges curling. The handwriting is neat, each letter penned with care. It reads:

"My Dearest Elara,

As the waves crash against the shore and the light of our beacon cuts through the night, I find my thoughts turning to you, and to the stories of old that I promised to share. There is one legend, in particular, that weighs heavily on my heart tonight, a tale passed down through generations of keepers before me.

They speak of the golden dragon, a guardian of ancient times whose light was as a second sun over our island. It was said to be a protector, a guiding force for good. But, as with all great powers, the fear of its turning loomed large â€” a guardian becoming a tyrant, a light turning to darkness.

I've seen strange lights in the depths of the night, far beyond where our beacon reaches. Movements that stir the water in ways no natural creature could. The elders dismiss them as tricks of the light or the imaginations of a solitary man. Yet, I cannot help but wonder if there is truth to the old stories, if the guardian stirs once more.

This legend, my dear, is a reminder that all great powers must be tempered with wisdom and restraint. As you grow, you will find your own power, your own light. Remember the tale of the golden dragon and seek not just to shine, but to illuminate the darkness with kindness and truth.

I keep this legend close to my heart, a beacon of my own, guiding me back to you. Until we meet again, let the light of our lighthouse remind you of my love and the stories we have yet to share.

With all my heart, Your father"
