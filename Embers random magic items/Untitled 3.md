## **Feat: Draconic Hybrid**

_Prerequisite: Character must have undergone the second Draconic Blood Transfusion and taken on the "Draconic Morph" feat._

You have continued your transformation into a draconic being, further embracing the power of your dragon bloodline. This transformation has granted you powerful abilities, but also brought you closer to your draconic heritage.

### **Features:**

**Draconic Scales (Stage 2)**

- **Scaly Defense:** Your scales now cover a significant portion of your body. Your AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier if it is not already higher.
- **Draconic Resistance:** You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your dragon (e.g., fire for a red dragon).

**Draconic Traits (Stage 2)**

- **Breath Weapon:** You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your Draconic Heritage determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
    - **Type:** Your breath weapon deals 3d6 damage in a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line (your choice). The damage increases by 1d6 for each additional level of this feat beyond Stage 2 (e.g., 4d6 at Stage 3).
    - **Recharge:** Once you use this trait, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Draconic Hybrid (Stage 3)**

- **Advanced Draconic Morph:** Your scales now cover 60% of your body, and your transformation deepens:
    - **Tail:** You grow a draconic tail, which can be used to make a tail attack as an unarmed strike. The tail attack deals 1d8 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage.
    - **Claws:** Your fingernails have transformed into claws, granting you a natural weapon. You can use your claws to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
    - **Reptilian Eyes:** Your eyes become fully reptilian, granting you darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

**Draconic Instincts (Stage 3)**

- **Draconic Pride:** You now have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. Your increasing dragon-like pride and confidence make you less susceptible to intimidation.
- **Treasure Sense:** Your draconic nature gives you an uncanny sense for valuable objects. You can sense the presence of precious metals and gemstones within 60 feet of you, though you cannot pinpoint their exact location.

**Draconic Magic (Stage 3)**

- **Draconic Spellcasting:** You gain the ability to cast the following spells associated with your draconic heritage:
    - **1st Level:** You can cast a 1st-level spell related to your dragon type (e.g., _Burning Hands_ for a red dragon). You can cast this spell once per long rest.
    - **2nd Level:** You gain access to a 2nd-level spell related to your dragon type (e.g., _Aganazzar's Scorcher_ for a red dragon). You can cast this spell once per long rest.
    - **Spellcasting Ability:** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
