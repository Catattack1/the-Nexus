### Name and Title

**Name**: Azura Nyx  
**Title**: The Guardian of Beellatoria/The Demon Lord

### Background and Personality

**Background:** Azura Nyx, formerly Alexander N. Hydro, was a man of immense courage and loyalty who died protecting his friends in a previous life. His selfless sacrifice did not go unnoticed by the universe, and he was reincarnated as a female succubus baby, fulfilling his secret desire to live as a woman. Over time, Azura grew into her new role and rose to become the Demon Lord, a title bestowed upon her not by birthright but by merit and the will of the universe.

**Personality:** Azura is a complex individual, embodying both fierce kindness and brutal justice. Filled with an overwhelming love and kindness, she often finds it painful to see others suffer. However, her empathy does not extend to those who commit evil acts. She deals with wrongdoers with a level of brutality that befits her title as Demon Lord, earning her the fear and hatred of many who do not understand her true nature.

Azura's love and kindness make her a beloved figure among her friends and those she considers allies. She is fiercely protective and will go to great lengths to defend them, fighting with a tenacity that borders on the feral. Despite her short temper and occasional pettiness, Azura strives to keep her cool and maintain patience, though she sometimes struggles with this, especially when pushed to her limits.

**Previous Life and Goals:** In her previous life, Azura had a close-knit group of friends whom she died protecting. Upon realizing she had been reincarnated, her primary goal became finding her friends or their reincarnations. Balancing this personal quest with her royal duties in Beellatoria, Azura often wanders the world, searching for signs of her past companions while maintaining order and justice in her realm.

### Appearance

Azura Nyx is a striking figure with an otherworldly beauty. She stands at an imposing height of 6 feet, with a lithe yet powerful build that exudes both grace and strength. Her skin is more akin to that of a human, a pale tone that contrasts sharply with her blood-crimson red eyes, which almost glow in the dark.

Her long, flowing hair is a cascade of midnight black, often adorned with intricate braids and small, magical trinkets. Despite her formidable presence, her outfit is almost stereotypically that of a succubus, consisting only of a pair of panties and a bra that barely covers anything. The bra vaguely resembles bat wings gripping her chest, emerging from underneath to cover her modest-sized breasts.

Azura's physique is deceptively delicate. At first glance, she appears petite, but closer inspection reveals a toned, athletic body with visible muscle definition. When she flexes, her muscles, including a defined six-pack, become apparent, showcasing her true strength. This combination of delicate appearance and underlying power makes her an intriguing and formidable presence.

### Role and Abilities

**Role in Beellatoria:** Azura is the sovereign ruler of Beellatoria, a nation primarily composed of demi-human races. Known derogatorily by outsiders as the "Land of Demons," Beellatoria is actually a beacon of progress and stability, thanks to Azura's leadership. Despite not being a natural-born leader, her innovative ideas and fair justice system have helped the kingdom flourish.

Azura's rule is characterized by technological advancements, modern luxuries, and a low level of corruption, thanks to her rotating council of advisors. She allows her council to handle most administrative tasks, preferring to focus on her personal quest and ensuring the continued well-being of her people.

**Powers and Abilities:** As the Demon Lord, Azura possesses immense power. This title, engraved upon her soul, grants her extraordinary magical and physical capabilities. Her powers include:

- **Brutal Justice**: Azura can sense evil intentions and acts with ruthless efficiency to punish wrongdoers.
- **Protective Aura**: She exudes a protective aura that shields her allies from harm, making her a formidable guardian.
- **Enhanced Strength and Agility**: Azura's physical capabilities are far beyond that of a typical succubus, allowing her to excel in both combat and defense.
- **Magic and Technology Integration**: Azura has a deep understanding of both magic and technology, enabling her to create powerful magitech devices that benefit her people.

## Full backstory
After being reincarnated, she was born as a succubus. As previously stated, she grew up in a small, quaint town in Bellatoria with her two parents, not knowing she was even a succubus from the moment she was born. She didn't innately have her memories, but when she turned about three, she suddenly regained them, realizing everything. Upon this realization, she started experimenting with all kinds of things and pressing her parents too. By that point, she could already read, write, and speak, but now she was starting to learn even faster. As far as they were aware, she quickly grasped concepts that were really complex, even magic, making them incredibly happy.

Shortly after her 8th birthday, a tragedy would happen. One day, when she was out playing with one of her friends, he suddenly grabbed her by the wrist and said, "Come on, let's go somewhere private." She was confused and a bit hesitant about why he grabbed her but went along because it was a friend—a close friend at that. He took her to a small, secluded area in the midst of town, a little, closed-off spot with a bed and candlelight. Her friend was a bit older, a teenager. She wasn't fully aware of his tendencies, as she didn’t go to the local school; she was homeschooled by her parents. She started to feel thankful for this when she realized what he was doing. As soon as she got a good look at the room, he locked the door and kept the key on a chain around his neck. He began to assault her in a way that I will not describe here in its entirety, but she managed to resist him from doing anything to her for almost an hour and a half before a paladin burst through the door, having heard her screams. The paladin quickly yanked the boy away and attempted to help Azura up.

After getting the boy tied up, she was hesitant to take the paladin's hand but asked to go home. While guiding the paladin to her home, the paladin realized, upon seeing the house, that this child was not human. The paladin had been sent to annihilate succubi that were "discovered" by an informant for the king, and they had been slaughtered. Those succubi were her parents. The paladin quickly tightened her grip on the child's hand, saying, "I was hoping you weren't theirs, those demons." Upon hearing this, Azura's eyes widened, realizing what happened. She could smell the iron—the blood in the air—and see that her family's home was open. The door was ajar, and she could see red beneath the opening. Looking at the paladin, shaking and concerned, she asked what happened. The paladin simply said, "I did my job, like I'm about to now." Grabbing their sword, Azura managed to yank away from the paladin. Now with a grim look of determination on their face, the paladin raised their sword to strike. Azura channeled as much magic as she could physically push through her tiny body, forcing the paladin away about 20 feet as she ran into the woods.

She kept running, refusing to stop. To avoid fatigue, she used magic to reinforce her body. The more magic she used, the more she realized she might be a demon because no human could put this much magic through their body and still live. They would either go feral or explode; magical overload always happened. Humans that sustained such power experienced severe physical drawbacks, but she could still run. She could still breathe as well as ever. She could do more. She ran for about half a day until she collapsed on the outskirts of a city. From her estimation, she had been running at about 34 mph—something not humanly possible, even in her old world—which meant she had traveled quite a distance.

Not knowing what city she was in, she tried to get up and continue moving. Hungry and desperate, she eventually found a bakery willing to spare some old bread. It was stale, but it was something. Later, she found a small inn that offered her a free meal and allowed her to stay for the night. She was thankful for their kindness. While in the inn, she looked at herself in the room’s mirror and noticed her eyes had turned red. She had read about this; it was a side effect of using more mana than humanly possible for long periods. She realized that while her body might be demonic, she was essentially a human child because her powers had not fully awakened yet. She washed her face in the basin, trying to remove any dirt. Every time she closed her eyes, flashes of the paladin came back to her. A distinct hatred began to form in her heart—not directed at anyone in particular, but at the fact that such things could happen to anyone. It made her furious, and the fact that it had happened to her brought her great sadness that threatened to overwhelm her. Yet, she did not give in to these feelings. She did her best to lay down and not think about it. Though her efforts were mostly in vain, she eventually grew tired enough to sleep.

After waking up in the morning, she received a free breakfast from the innkeeper, who was oddly hospitable. However, the innkeeper admitted that she wouldn’t be able to do much more for her, as she didn’t have enough money to keep supporting her and her family. She apologized for the inconvenience. Azura wasn’t perturbed, though; the innkeeper had already done more than enough to restore some faith in humanity. Azura headed off, going deeper into the city, stumbling from place to place, getting food where she could, surviving off the kindness of others, but more often than not, being turned away at every possible place.

This went on for years as she bounced from place to place. On her 18th birthday, her demon powers started to manifest. She noticed people suddenly being unconditionally kind to her, and the next day, she found that she had sprouted a small tail overnight. The tail ended in a spaded heart that was uncomfortably sharp at the tip, feeling like it could cut flesh like a freshly sharpened fillet knife. This bothered her. She tried to cut it off, but no matter what she used, her tail remained intact. As it grew longer over the next few days, it became even sharper.

Eventually, she found a library in the city. Though she hadn’t gone far from the people who had helped her before, she ventured inside. The librarians gave her a small talisman signifying that she had entry. Though technically, she didn’t qualify for it, they allowed her to have one anyway, as they had seen her around enough to know she didn’t have a home. She began reading about what she was: a succubus. She learned that succubi naturally attracted people and, even after awakening, wouldn’t need to "feed" on people to survive, which came as a huge relief. She also learned that the attraction magic was a permanent part of her being. Though she couldn’t fully turn it off, she could dull it to the point that people wouldn’t notice. Her tail, however, would be a permanent addition to her appearance. She silently thanked her parents for being the type of succubi that didn’t have horns, even though she knew they had no control over that.

She often hid her tail by wrapping it around her waist under her clothes, ensuring no one would see it. People in the capital city weren’t especially judgmental. There were plenty of demons, humans, and other races living together in Bellatoria, especially here, in what she now knew was the capital. Its prosperity stood in stark contrast to the sparse and desolate other cities in the region, including her small hometown. Those memories, however, became distant as she focused on surviving this new hell.

One day, shortly after her 18th birthday, she was cornered by a gang of ruffians who had unseemly intentions. She managed to escape, having become adept at slipping away, but the city continued to reveal its dangers. She realized it was worse than anywhere she had lived before. One wrong step down the wrong alley could mean death, and she knew it. She feared letting anyone see her tail, knowing it was a clear signifier that she was a succubus. Among demons, succubi were treated as prized commodities, more like items than people. Even other demons viewed them this way.

Her red eyes also drew attention. Not everyone understood what they signified, but those who did became highly intrigued, often bombarding her with questions. She shut down every time someone tried to talk to her for more than a few seconds, making it difficult for anyone to truly understand what had happened to her.

Close to her 20th birthday, just a few days away, she was approached by a squire in ornate, mostly decorative armor. Suspicious, she asked, “What do you want?” The squire stated that he had been sent to invite her to the palace for a one-on-one audience with the king due to her intriguing nature. She had heard stories about the king: what happened to people who denied his requests, and what happened to those who accepted. Either way, she felt she was likely to end up somewhere she didn’t want to be—or dead. Reluctantly, she went along with the squire.

She was brought directly before the king, a tall, imposing man with two curved, ram-like horns jutting from his skull, deep red in color. His eyes glowed with an ethereal purple as he said, “So you’re the tainted succubus I’ve heard so much about. You’ve managed to keep your innocence, despite being a succubus.” As he spoke, he approached her, and she was brought to her knees by an unworldly presence, unable to stand. He continued, “I am here to ensure you understand what a succubus is meant for in society—your job and purpose in life.” Gently lifting her chin with his hand, he added, “You’re going to be the most fun I’ve had in a long time.”

At that moment, something snapped in her mind. Her tail lashed out, severing the king’s head from his shoulders. It hit the ground with a wet thud as gasps echoed throughout the throne room. Everyone stared in disbelief. Before she could get up, her body lurched. Time seemed to stop, and the world turned gray. A voice, neither of the gods nor demons but of reality itself, emanated, saying, “A new demon lord has arisen. Go forth and claim your title.”

As the voice faded, time crawled forward again. Her body began to ache as she watched her limbs lengthen. Her waist widened, her stomach became visibly toned, and her shoulders slimmed. Her thighs thickened, her breasts expanded, and two small wings sprouted from her back. Her tail fully elongated. Her body had undergone a full metamorphosis into a fully grown succubus. Whatever this new demon lord power was, it had forcefully accelerated her physical aging. As time resumed, the king’s body, still mid-fall, struck the ground with a splatter. Before anyone could react, she kicked it across the room, sending it flying into the throne. Walking to the throne, she threw what was left of the king’s body to the side and sat down, unsure of what to do next.

The squire who had brought her there suddenly ran at her, sword drawn, aiming for her head. Without thinking, her tail lashed out again, severing his arm at the elbow. She stood, staring at the bloodied stump, surprised by how instinctively her body had moved. She hadn’t even needed to think about it.
