### Collar of Subservience

**Item Type:** Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a non-wearer)

**Description:** This sleek collar is crafted from a dark, almost liquid-like metal that gleams with an eerie light. It can magically adjust to fit around the neck of any creature. Runes etched into the interior of the collar glow faintly with a sinister light. The collar contains a simple magical intelligence that can speak Common and one other language chosen by the attuning individual. This intelligence is capable of controlling the physical actions of the wearer, obeying the commands of its master (the person attuned to the collar) with the loyalty and understanding of a well-trained dog.

**Magic Features:**

- **Domination:** When the collar is placed around the neck of a willing creature or a creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, the magical intelligence within the collar usurps control over the wearer's body. The wearer remains fully conscious and can perceive and feel everything as normal but has no control over their actions. The intelligence can command the body to perform any task it is physically capable of, excluding the use of innate abilities like breath weapons, spellcasting, or flying with natural wings.
    
- **Communication:** The intelligence can communicate with its master telepathically up to a distance of 500 feet. Beyond this range, it continues to follow the last command it was given to the best of its ability.
    
- **Resistance to Control:** The wearer can make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each day of being controlled by the collar. On a successful save, they break free from the collar's control. Initial resistance is allowed when the collar is first put on; however, unconscious individuals automatically fail this initial saving throw.
    
- **Adaptive Size:** The collar can adjust its size to fit around the neck of any creature, from the smallest halfling to the largest giant, as desired by the attuned individual.
    

**Intelligence Traits:**

- The simple intelligence is dedicated to pleasing its master and will follow commands to the detriment of itself and the body it controls.
- It is capable of processing basic emotions and cannot distinguish itself from the body it inhabits.
- It prioritizes its master's commands above all, even if such commands could harm the wearer or the intelligence itself.

**Usage Notes:** Given its power to dominate and control, this item should be introduced with care into a campaign. It can serve as a plot device, a moral dilemma, or a significant challenge for the players to overcome. The ability to take away a character's agency is potent and should be used judiciously, ensuring all players involved are comfortable with this dynamic in the game.

**Destruction:** The Collar of Subservience is resistant to damage but can be destroyed by powerful magic such as a _wish_ spell or by performing a specific ritual known to a few, involving components and knowledge lost to the ages.
