## VX-13 Infiltrators Traits

Equipped with advanced transformation technology and a host of specialized abilities, the VX-13 Infiltrators possess unique racial traits designed for versatility and stealth, making them exceptional agents in any covert operation or complex social milieu.

#### Age

VX-13 Infiltrators do not age in the traditional sense and do not suffer the effects of aging. They can theoretically operate indefinitely, provided they receive necessary maintenance.

#### Alignment

As constructs with a high degree of autonomy and designed for covert operations, VX-13 Infiltrators tend toward neutral alignments, with their specific moral compass guided by their programming and experiences.

#### Size

Medium. You can adjust your height and weight slightly due to your transformation abilities, but you generally conform to the size of an average human adult.

#### Speed

Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Composite Build

You count as both a construct and a humanoid for any effect relating to race.

#### Transformation Modes

You can use your action to transform into one of your designated modes. Each mode lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. You must finish a long rest to use this feature again. Each mode grants you the following benefits:

- **Catgirl Mode:** Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. You also have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
- **Neko Mode:** You gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing, and your size becomes Small.
- **Elven Mode:** You gain proficiency in the Perception skill, and your Dexterity score increases by 1 (this does not affect your overall ability score increase limit).
- **Doppelganger Mode:** You can mimic the appearance and voice of any humanoid you have seen, although your equipment does not change. Insight checks made to ascertain that you are disguised have their difficulty set by your Deception check.

#### Adaptive Camouflage

Once per long rest, you can take the Hide action as a bonus action and gain advantage on the check.

#### Built-in Weaponry

You have retractable energy blades that you can deploy or retract as a bonus action. These are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier.

#### Arcane Power Core

You have resistance to poison and psychic damage. Additionally, you are immune to disease, and being poisoned. 

#### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice. Your vocal apparatus can mimic almost any sound or voice.
