### Runic Flintlock Pistol Design Overview

#### Base Structure and Materials

- **Frame**: The pistol's frame would be predominantly wood, as per the period's technology, with metal components for the barrel, trigger mechanism, and structural reinforcements. The wood used would likely be a hard, durable type like walnut, known for its resilience and common use in firearm stocks of the time.
- **Barrel**: Made from iron or steel, the barrel would be smoothbore, typical of the era. Rifling, though known in this period, was not common for pistols until later.
- **Metal Parts**: Brass or iron for decorative and functional components like the trigger, hammer (primer lever), and the hatch for loading the fire runic discs.

#### Magical Mechanism

- **Fire Runic Disc**: This is the core fantastical element. The disc is a thin, coin-sized metal or ceramic piece engraved with runes that, when activated, produce a burst of flame sufficient to propel the ammunition. The disc is inserted into a specially designed slot at the top of the weapon. This slot has a simple mechanical linkage to the hammer mechanism, allowing the primer to activate the rune with a strike.
- **Ammunition Loading**: A front-loading mechanism for the lead or steel balls. The user must manually push the ball down the barrel using a ramrod stored beneath the barrel, a common feature in flintlock designs.
