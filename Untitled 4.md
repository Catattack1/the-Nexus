### NPC 1: Sir Alaric Thorne

**Background and Personality:**

Sir Alaric Thorne is a former knight captain who was renowned for his martial prowess and tactical genius. He led numerous successful campaigns and was celebrated as a hero in his prime. Despite his fearsome reputation on the battlefield, Alaric is a man of deep compassion and honor, qualities that often set him apart from his more ruthless peers. His retirement came as a shock to many, as he was still at the peak of his abilities, but his love for his wife, Lyra, outweighed his desire for glory.

**Appearance:**

Alaric is a tall, imposing figure, standing at 6'3" with a muscular build honed from years of combat. His hair is a mix of gray and black, and he wears it short. His piercing blue eyes reflect both his wisdom and his determination. Though retired, he maintains a vigilant posture, and his presence commands respect. Alaric often dresses in simple but well-made clothing, preferring practicality over ostentation. However, he still keeps his knightly armor and sword in pristine condition, a reminder of his past and a symbol of his enduring strength.

**Background Story:**

During his final mission as a knight captain, Alaric was tasked with eliminating a tribe of kobolds that were supposedly causing trouble. However, upon confronting the tribe, he discovered that they were not the threat they were made out to be. Among them was Lyra, a kobold with an incredible intellect and a gentle spirit. Through a series of unexpected events, Alaric found himself captivated by her resilience and charm. Rather than carrying out his orders, he negotiated with the tribe, ensuring their safety in exchange for their non-interference in human affairs. To protect Lyra and bring her into his life, he orchestrated a ruse, presenting her as a captive and convincing the authorities to allow him to keep her as a "slave." Once home, he freed her and declared his love, leading to their eventual marriage.

**Role in the City:**

In retirement, Alaric plays a crucial role as a mediator and advisor in the city, leveraging his reputation and connections to maintain peace and order. He is a beloved figure among the people, known for his fairness and unwavering dedication to justice. His presence ensures the city remains safe, and his endorsement of Lyra's magitech innovations has helped the city prosper.

### NPC 2: Lyra Thorne
