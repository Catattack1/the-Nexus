### **Curse of the Depraved Doppelganger**

**Description:** The Curse of the Depraved Doppelganger is an insidious and powerful enchantment designed to ensnare its victim in a web of perversion and mental degradation. This curse mimics the attributes of other curses for a period of time, lulling the victim into a false sense of understanding before revealing its true, more twisted nature. It profoundly affects both the body and mind, leading to a perverse and highly disturbing outcome unless prevented.

**Effects:**

1. **Mimicry Phase:**
    
    - **Initial Mimicry:** Upon being afflicted, the curse initially mimics the attributes of another curse known to the victim or one of the curses the caster chooses. This phase lasts for 1d4 weeks.
    - **False Security:** During this phase, the victim believes they are dealing with a different, less severe curse. They experience all the usual symptoms and effects of the mimicked curse, leading them to seek solutions or remedies for the wrong affliction.
2. **Transformation Phase:**
    
    - **Gradual Reveal:** After the mimicry phase, the curse begins to reveal its true nature. The victim starts experiencing increasingly perverse and disturbing transformations.
    - **Physical Changes:** The victim's body undergoes grotesque transformations that enhance sexual and perverse features. Their clothing becomes prone to falling apart, exposing them frequently in embarrassing ways.
    - **Mental Degradation:** The victim's mind is twisted, causing them to crave and seek out perverse situations. They become obsessed with their own body and others, often acting inappropriately and without shame.
3. **Perverse Instincts:**
    
    - **Heightened Libido:** The victim's sexual desires are amplified to an uncontrollable degree, making it difficult for them to focus on anything other than their cravings.
    - **Compulsive Behavior:** They develop compulsive behaviors such as exhibitionism, voyeurism, and inappropriate touching. These behaviors are difficult to resist and occur more frequently as the curse progresses.
    - **Loss of Control:** The victim occasionally loses control of their actions entirely, acting purely on base instincts and desires. This can lead to dangerous or socially unacceptable situations.
4. **Severe Mental Effects:**
    
    - **Split Personality:** The curse creates a secondary, perverse personality within the victim. This personality occasionally takes control, acting out the victim's deepest, most depraved desires.
    - **Nightmarish Visions:** The victim is plagued by nightmarish visions and hallucinations that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. These visions often involve perverse and disturbing imagery.
    - **Isolation:** Friends and loved ones become increasingly uncomfortable around the victim, leading to social isolation and further mental deterioration.
5. **Irremovable by Normal Means:**
    
    - **Complex Ritual Required:** The curse cannot be removed by standard magical means such as _remove curse_. It requires a complex and dangerous ritual involving rare components and the assistance of a powerful and knowledgeable spellcaster.
    - **Self-Sacrifice:** The ritual often requires a significant personal sacrifice from the victim, such as enduring a period of extreme mental and physical torment or giving up something of great personal value.

**Activation and Frequency:**

- The curse activates unpredictably, with no set interval between incidents. However, the likelihood of activation increases with the victim's exposure to situations that would typically trigger perverse thoughts or actions.
- The DM can roll a d100 to determine the probability of the curse activating during any given situation, with higher chances when the victim is under stress or in social settings.

**Role-Playing the Curse:**

- Characters afflicted by the Curse of the Depraved Doppelganger will find themselves in increasingly disturbing and perverse situations. This curse adds a dark and challenging dynamic to the game.
- The character may struggle to maintain their sanity and relationships as the curse progresses, providing rich opportunities for role-playing and character development.
- Allies may seek to help the victim by finding ways to manage the symptoms, perform the complex ritual, or uncover the true nature of the curse.

**Example Incidents:**

1. **Social Gathering:** The victim's clothes inexplicably fall apart at a formal event, causing extreme embarrassment and inappropriate behavior.
2. **Combat Situation:** During a fight, the victim suddenly loses control, acting seductively towards enemies and allies alike, disrupting the flow of battle.
3. **Solitude:** While alone, the victim is haunted by nightmarish visions that blur the lines between reality and perverse fantasy, driving them to act out their darkest desires.

**Unique Ritual for Removal:**

- The ritual to remove the Curse of the Depraved Doppelganger requires the following:
    - A mirror forged from black obsidian and blessed under the light of a blood moon.
    - The heart of a creature known for its purity and innocence, symbolizing the sacrifice of purity.
    - A vial of the victim's own blood, collected during a moment of pure and selfless intention.
    - The ashes of a powerful artifact of purity, representing the destruction of the victim's previous innocence.
- The ritual must be performed at a sacred or cursed site under specific conditions, reflecting the victim's willingness to confront and overcome their own perversions and darkest desires.
