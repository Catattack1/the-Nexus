### Magic Item: Stormreaper Sickles

**Category:** Weapon (Sickle)  
**Rarity:** Legendary  
**Attunement:** Yes, by a character with proficiency in sickles and a strong affinity for the forces of nature or the tempest.

**Description:** Forged from the heart of a tempest, the Stormreaper Sickles gleam with a perpetual stormy light, their blades crackling with electric energy. The metal, dark as a storm cloud and veined with patterns that resemble lightning strikes, seems to hum with contained power. The handles are wrapped in the hide of a creature that once commanded the storm, ensuring grip in the fiercest of tempests.

**Magic Item Properties:**

- **Attack and Damage Bonus:** Each sickle grants a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
- **Thunderous Strike:** On a successful hit, the wielder can invoke the fury of the storm to unleash a thunderous explosion, dealing an additional 2d8 thunder damage to the target and 1d8 thunder damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.
- **Chain Lightning:** Once per long rest, the wielder can cast the _chain lightning_ spell (save DC 17) from one of the sickles, without using a spell slot.
- **Storm's Swiftness:** While wielding at least one of the Stormreaper Sickles, the user's movement speed increases by 10 feet. When wielding both, they also gain the ability to fly at their movement speed for up to 10 minutes per day, which can be used in increments of 1 minute. This flight mimics the swift, darting movements of a storm.
- **Tempest's Wrath:** When both sickles are wielded together, they can be slammed into the ground as an action to summon a localized storm (30-foot radius) centered on the wielder. This storm lasts for 1 minute, causing heavy rain and strong winds that impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks passing into or out of the storm. Enemies that start their turn within the storm take 1d6 lightning damage. This ability can be used once per long rest.
- **Stormforged Resilience:** The wielder gains resistance to lightning and thunder damage.

**Attunement:** The attunement process requires the wielder to survive a night alone in the heart of a natural storm, embracing its power and proving their resilience against the tempest's fury.

**Lore:** The Stormreaper Sickles were created by a cabal of storm sorcerers and tempest clerics during a rare celestial alignment, under the guidance of a deity of storms. Intended as a tool to cull the unnatural darkness that threatened the world, these sickles have since been passed down to those who can harness and respect the raw power of the storm. They serve as a reminder that even the most destructive forces of nature can be wielded for the cause of balance and justice.
