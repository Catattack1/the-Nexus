### **Hero Name:** Centurion

### **Real Name:** David (i fuger)

#### **Appearance:**

- **Height:** 5'10"
- **Suit:** Primarily white and blue with hints of silver.
- **Weapons:** Dual swords with electrostatic enhancements.

#### **Abilities:**

1. **Electrostatic Control:**
    
    - **Primary Use:** Generating bursts of electricity and arcs of lightning.
    - **Maximum Distance:** 200 feet for controlled arcs.
    - **Extended Use:** Can manipulate electrical currents beyond generating arcs, such as short-circuiting devices, enhancing technological equipment, or creating electromagnetic fields.
    - **Power Output:** Capable of generating up to 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to incapacitate most foes and disrupt electronic systems.
2. **Enhanced Speed:**
    
    - **Speed:** Can run at speeds up to 80 mph (approximately 128 km/h), significantly faster than Usain Bolt but not approaching the speeds of characters like the Flash.
    - **Reaction Time:** Enhanced reflexes allowing for split-second decision-making and dodging attacks with ease.
3. **Enhanced Strength:**
    
    - **Strength Level:** Can lift up to 1,000 pounds (approximately 450 kg) under optimal conditions.
    - **Combat Use:** Strength is used primarily for melee combat, allowing him to overpower typical street-level threats with ease.
4. **Enhanced Durability:**
    
    - **Durability Level:** Skin and muscle tissue can withstand blunt force trauma equivalent to being hit by a car at 30 mph without significant injury. Resistant to small arms fire and minor explosions.
    - **Suit Durability:** The suit is reinforced with advanced materials to provide additional protection against extreme temperatures, electrical attacks, and ballistic impacts.
5. **Accelerated Healing Factor:**
    
    - **Healing Rate:** Minor injuries (cuts, bruises) heal within minutes. More severe injuries (broken bones, deep lacerations) can heal within hours to a day, depending on the severity.
    - **Regenerative Limits:** Cannot regenerate lost limbs or organs but can recover from injuries that would be fatal to a normal human with sufficient time and rest.

#### **Personality:**

- **Traits:** David is determined, resourceful, and highly disciplined. He has a strong sense of justice and a protective instinct, particularly for the innocent and vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses:** Tends to take on too much responsibility, occasionally leading to burnout. His protective nature can make him reckless in dangerous situations if he believes others are at risk.

#### **Background:**

David was a former soldier who gained his abilities through a classified military experiment involving the infusion of nanotechnology and bioelectric enhancement. Disillusioned by the government's misuse of his powers, he took on the mantle of Centurion to protect those who cannot protect themselves. Operating as a street-level hero, Centurion focuses on cleaning up his city's streets, battling organized crime, and thwarting technological threats.

#### **Equipment:**

- **Swords:** Forged from a lightweight, super-strong alloy. Enhanced with his electrostatic control to deliver electrified strikes.
- **Suit:** Made from a composite material that is both lightweight and highly durable. Contains insulated layers to protect against electrical feedback and external temperature extremes.
