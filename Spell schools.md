In Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), magic is categorized into different schools, each with its own fundamental principles, strengths, and typical abilities. Here's a brief overview of each school and what it encompasses:

1. **Abjuration**: The school of protection and banishing. It focuses on spells that block, banish, or protect. Common spells include magical barriers, negating magical effects, and protecting against magical and physical attacks. Abjurers are excellent at warding off damage and ensuring the safety of themselves and their allies.

2. **Conjuration**: The school of summoning and creation. Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another, summoning creatures to help you, and creating objects or effects out of thin air. Conjurers can bring forth allies, teleport, and produce needed materials or effects spontaneously.

3. **Divination**: The school of foresight and information. Divination spells reveal information, whether it be in the form of visions of the future, revealing hidden things, or understanding languages. Diviners are adept at gathering intelligence, predicting future events, and uncovering hidden knowledge.

4. **Enchantment**: The school of mind control and manipulation. Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling behavior. This can include charming people to make them friends or putting enemies to sleep. Enchanters are skilled at bending others to their will and altering perceptions.

5. **Evocation**: The school of elemental energy and raw magical power. Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect, such as conjuring fireballs, lightning bolts, or blasts of cold. Evokers specialize in dealing damage and are capable of wielding the raw forces of magic to devastating effect.

6. **Illusion**: The school of deception and misdirection. Illusion spells create false images and sounds or alter the perception of reality. Illusionists are masters of trickery, capable of making themselves invisible, creating illusory duplicates, or making something appear out of nowhere.

7. **Necromancy**: The school of life, death, and undeath. Contrary to the common association with only death and undeath, necromancy also involves spells that manipulate the forces of life and death. This includes raising the dead, draining life energy from another creature, and restoring life to the dead. Necromancers are proficient in controlling the undead and manipulating life forces.

8. **Transmutation**: The school of change and transformation. Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition. They can turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, or change lead into gold. Transmuters excel in altering physical realities, be it transforming objects or creatures, or enhancing physical abilities.

Each school of magic in D&D offers a wide range of possibilities, allowing players to specialize in the type of magic that best suits their character's personality and the needs of their adventuring party.
