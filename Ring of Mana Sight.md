### Magic Item: Ring of Mana Sight

**Category:** Wondrous Item  
**Rarity:** Rare  
**Attunement:** Yes

**Description:** The Ring of Mana Sight is a delicately crafted band, typically made from silver or another precious metal, with arcane symbols encircling it. At its center sits a small gem that seems to pulse with an inner light, especially in areas rich in magical energy. When worn, the ring allows the attuned wearer to perceive the flow of mana in their surroundings, revealing currents of magical energy invisible to the naked eye.

**Properties:**

- **Mana Sight:** While wearing the ring, the attuned user can activate it to gain the ability to see mana in their immediate environment. This sight reveals concentrations of magical energy, its flow direction, and the presence of different schools of magic. The user can distinguish between the various schools of magic (e.g., Evocation, Necromancy) by the color and behavior of the mana flows.
    
- **Duration and Cooldown:** The ring can be used for up to 1 hour per day, which can be broken up into shorter durations. After deactivating the ring or reaching the maximum daily usage, it requires a long rest to recharge its mana sight capabilities.
    
- **Overuse Risk:** If a user attempts to extend the ring's abilities beyond the allotted time, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the user suffers a level of exhaustion as the overload of magical sight overwhelms their senses. On a successful save, they avoid exhaustion but cannot activate the ring again until after a long rest.
    
- **Limitations:** While the ring allows for the perception of mana and its general properties, it does not grant the ability to see through illusions or identify specific spells being cast. It reveals the presence and type of magic but not its purpose or effects.
    

**Attunement:** The process of attuning to the Ring of Mana Sight involves the wearer spending a short period in meditation, focusing on the flow of magic around them and syncing their senses to the ring's capabilities.
