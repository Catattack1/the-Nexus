The setting the environment is that of the abandoned island with several small settlements on it and a slightly larger city all of this is a high fantasy setting with equivalent technology to early World War 2 on this island they are ancient civilization strongholds these ancient civilization strongholds have been lost to time and no one at the current era realizes they exist on this island these strong holds holds an ancient AI that is far beyond the limits of technology nowadays and these ancient AI's and machines do not have access to magic unlike the current civilization currently all settlements and cities on this island have been rendered clean of any living humanoid species and several attempts have been made to figure out what happened on the island from outside forces approximately 6 two previous attempts from varying levels of government have sent and there's very little in the ways of humanoid remains anybody that was in the settlement there is no skeletal remains although there is a few roaming undead here and there do to plenty of mystical hijinks but right before the collapse foreign fauna various high fantasy flowers magical varieties and also natural plants it's a semi tropical island with a massive forest in the center with  a mountainous region in the middle i'll provide character details in I'll provide character details in a moment the next message ask for narrative structure I wish for it to be an action adventure story with a  mystery element because the players were hired to uncover what happened by a Duke for the Kingdom of The Empire of Solara the details of such aren't that important what is important as the 4 players were hired to be a facet and "elite" military unit for the Kingdom and there these four individuals were hired through various means which I will detail at a later date what is important is they were been hired as a "elite" task force of sorts to pacifically figure out what happened on this island and if at all possible recover any survivors and reestablish the island as habitable and safe for the conflict it should be against nature and robots of evering designs and potentially undead foes quests and missions should be more of a up to them decision there is particular ones they can take but overall the missions are nonlinear and have an end goal but varying ways to solve it to get to that point and the resolution should be coming to terms with the I harmonizing with it or destroying it entirely

**To: Siigonis-Med-Dovah**

**From: His Grace, Duke Elarion of the Empire of Solara**

**Subject: Personalized Mission Brief - Operation Resurgence**

Esteemed Siigonis-Med-Dovah,

Your unique heritage as a were-dragon lizardfolk and your dual upbringing under the tutelage of a pink dragon and a grey dragon have caught the attention of the Empire. Your skills as a bard-warrior make you an invaluable asset to this mission.

**Mission Objective:** As part of the elite task force, you are to investigate the abandoned island and uncover the reasons behind the disappearance of its inhabitants. Your specific roles will include:

1. **Cultural Insight:** Your background in bardic lore and warrior training will be crucial in deciphering any cultural or historical artifacts found on the island.
2. **Combat and Diplomacy:** Given your dual nature, you are uniquely equipped to engage in both combat and negotiation, should we encounter any sentient beings or remnants of the ancient civilization.
3. **Personal Goals:** This mission may provide opportunities to further your own ambitions, such as mastering your were form, expanding your hoard of gold and honey, and perhaps finding acceptance amongst other dragonkind.

**Operational Details:**

- Maintain discretion regarding your were-dragon identity, unless necessary for the mission.
- Utilize your bardic abilities to document and interpret any ancient songs, stories, or lore we may encounter.
- Your combat skills will be essential in protecting the team from unexpected threats.

**Equipment:**

- You will be provided with standard exploration gear, as well as specific items that cater to your unique abilities, including ample supply of honey for sustenance.
- Feel free to bring your one-man band and your father's longsword for both personal comfort and defense.

**Remuneration:**

- In addition to the standard compensation, we will ensure a substantial addition to your hoard of gold and honey upon successful completion of the mission.

**Personal Note:** Your fears and aspirations are not unknown to us. This mission might offer you a chance to face those fears and find a sense of belonging and acceptance, not just among dragons but within the broader world. Your journey is as much about discovering the island's secrets as it is about exploring your own identity.

May your scales be tough and your songs resonate with the truths you seek.

**His Grace, Duke Elarion of the Empire of Solara**

**1. Name:** [DeathWish, his unchosen titles used by the people that pay for his services.
Real name: Arlin Valkin RayFeather]

**2. Race/Species:** [Was half human half elf before becoming a lich,]

**3. Class/Profession:** [Arlin made a profession for himself becoming an assassin, to a contract killer, to an almost hollow ronin at the moment.]

**4. Background:** [Arlin's background starts with his mother, Melinoe giving birth to him when a few months afterwards some people got sent to kill Melinoe & take the child, but Melinoe protects him for quite a few years, giving to Arlin some money, a necklace, food, then giving him a small Dagger made of ivory and some sort of metal & gold mix in it's hilt, with a nice design of a few red lines like ribbons down its length from hilt to tip. She sends the boy off to some sort of relative that is killed about 2 years later, not giving the boy much of use but pain & fear. By his teens, Arlin is a wandering contract killer known as Deathwish, a ronin whom hides himself, taking out his targets swiftly & quietly, then on a contract that his father set up, he gets kidnapped & imprisoned, his father visiting every week to give the boy food & to try to convince the boy that once he's of age, he will be let go to rule the kingdom. Arlin barely believed his father because of all of the truth that his mother has told him about his father, yet he tried and tried to escape, but continued to fail so until he was an adult & was finally let out, he broke away from his father's guards, running away & then getting swept up by an unknown group that captures the boy for ransom, then instead for an unknown reason, being told to become a lich or die. They trained the boy non-stop for about a year before the transformation was complete, but in an ironic twist; Arlin now had enough power to fight back from them. So he murdered most of the group, intimidating the rest to walk out of the front door, then contracting with some people to try and keep his head down in the best way he knew, leaving the continent to try and make money to find his mother & to get revenge on his father.]

 **5. Physical Description:** [Arlin wears black & silver clothing, boots with silver laces, Jeans, a fully black, cloth, shirt under a big, puffy jacket & cloak behind a black, samurai face mask. His height is about 6.2, a thin & tall but toned body build with pretty good abs, Hazel eyes & long, curly, brownish black hair with golden glasses. His distinguishing features are mostly that he has scratches down his arms, neck, & legs that he keeps covered, aswell ashis skin being insanely pale. He also has freckles sprinkled around his body & signs of abuse that I wont get into right now.]

**6. Personality Traits:** [comes off crass most of the time, he's self reserved, partly self absorbed not to the point of being unhealthy, mainly looks out for himself, but doesnt mix with people all too well. He has ticks, he sometimes will squeeze the pummel of his sword when angry, and if needed to, he can act posh and snobbish in social situations that might require such; But for the most part, he keeps to himself socially.]

**7. Goals and Ambitions:** [his goals are to find his mother, kill his father, and track down the group that made him into a lich aswell as hopefully find his friend to talk to him.]



**8. Allies and Adversaries:** [His parents were Melinoe RayFeather and Sterling Demeris. He was a bastard child in the form of his mother, Melinoe being forced to marry some form of royalty, AKA Sterling. Melinoe was a bounty hunter, assassin, and sold her body for a select few years. His father on the other hand was a snobbish detective & downright disgusting, self-absorbed shell of a man with too much money. Arlin was also friends with a boy named Weaver when he was young until Weaver got involved with the same people that made him into a lich.(you can determine Weaver's gender, age, race, whatever.) His father wanted a precautionary heir, therefore he... forced Melinoe to give him a child, then promptly trying to kill her after the child was born, but failing. All of these characters are still alive.]

**9. Beliefs and Values:** [DeathWish personally believes in fair judgement, but if provoked he will solve the problem with his hands. He also thinks people are not to be trusted and the dead are to be respected, which has changed since he has become a lich, seen by him desecrating a corpse & ripping off its backpack for himself.]

**10. Fears and Weaknesses:** [spiders, the unknown, (people occasionally) and ending up alone becauseofhis status of near-immortal.]

**11. Skills and Special Abilities:** [Unique skills, talents, or special abilities the character possesses, relevant to their background or class]

**12. Secrets and Mysteries:** [Some hidden aspects of him are his parents, him constantly hiding his face, his demeanor, and his general aggression towards people in general but more or less to the law.]

**13. Equipment and Treasures:** [A small necklace that looks like a Yin-Yang symbol which explains his grey-moral-area demeanor, but also holds a small fold-up knife that he wraps around his wrist from time to time & plays with when hes nervous.]

**14. Quirks and Habits:** [Even though the lich can barely taste, he eats when he's legitimately nervous anout something & occasionally twitches in the manner of a quick snap of his neck to the left or right, his hands shaking lightly, or him bouncing his leg and holding his hands together when seated.]
