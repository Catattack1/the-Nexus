**Multiattack:** The Valkyrie makes two sword attacks and one shield bash.

**Sword of Ages:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 35 (6d8 + 10) slashing damage.

**Shield Bash:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +19 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 28 (4d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Healing Touch (3/Day):** The Valkyrie touches another creature. The target magically regains 50 hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

**Missile Barrage:** The Valkyrie launches a barrage of magical missiles from its back. This attack automatically hits and does not require an attack roll. The Valkyrie creates fifteen darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of the Valkyrie's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and the Valkyrie can direct them to hit one creature or several.

**Devastating Laser (Recharge 5-6):** The Valkyrie charges for a moment before unleashing a devastating laser attack. This action requires a full turn to charge. On the following turn, the Valkyrie makes a ranged spell attack with a +14 bonus against a target within 150 feet. On a hit, the target takes 10d10 radiant damage. This attack has a high chance of hitting due to its speed and precision, giving the target disadvantage on any Dexterity saving throws to dodge or reduce the damage.
