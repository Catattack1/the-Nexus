**Kitsune Mage:** "I'm searching for an ancient spell, one that is said to bend the very fabric of time. 'Tiid-Klo-Ul' (Time-Sand-Eternity), as it was known in your tongue."

**Dragon:** "Tiid-Klo-Ul, krent. Hin laan vodahmin ok." (Time-Sand-Eternity, shattered. Your quest is forgotten.)

**Kitsune Mage:** "I'll do my best. Farewell, mighty dragon. May the skies carry your roar far and wide."
