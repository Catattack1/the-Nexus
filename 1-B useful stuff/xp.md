### 1. **Increased Base XP for Monsters**

- **Example Monsters and XP Adjustments:**
    - **Goblin (CR 1/4):** Normal XP = 50, Modified XP = 75 (50% increase)
    - **Ogre (CR 2):** Normal XP = 450, Modified XP = 675 (50% increase)
    - **Hill Giant (CR 5):** Normal XP = 1,800, Modified XP = 2,700 (50% increase)
    - **Adult Red Dragon (CR 17):** Normal XP = 18,000, Modified XP = 27,000 (50% increase)
- These examples show a consistent 50% increase in the XP rewards for defeating monsters of varying challenge ratings.

### 2. **Bonus XP for Challenging Monsters**

- **Player Level vs. Monster CR Example:**
    - If a party of level 4 characters defeats a CR 7 creature (like a Young Green Dragon), which normally grants 2,900 XP:
        - Base Modified XP = 2,900 * 1.5 (50% increase) = 4,350 XP
        - Challenge Bonus (3 levels higher, 50% bonus) = 2,900 * 0.5 = 1,450 XP
        - Total XP for this encounter = 4,350 + 1,450 = 5,800 XP

### 3. **XP for Skill Check Bonuses**

- **Skill Check Types and Bonus XP:**
    - **Disarming a Trap:**
        - DC 15 check: Rolling exactly 15 grants 25 XP; rolling 20 grants 50 XP (25 base + 25 for beating DC by 5).
    - **Performing Acrobatic Stunts:**
        - DC 12 check: Rolling 12 grants 25 XP; rolling 17 grants 40 XP (25 base + 15 for beating DC by 5).
    - **Negotiating with NPCs:**
        - DC 18 check: Rolling 18 grants 25 XP; rolling 24 grants 55 XP (25 base + 30 for beating DC by 6).
- The XP bonus increases by 5 XP for every point the roll exceeds the DC, encouraging players to strive for higher rolls.
