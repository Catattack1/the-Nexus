# Kaida Tomiko
### Character Profile: Kaida Tomiko

**Race:** Fox Beast Folk  
**class:** warlock
**level:** 1 
**Appearance**

Kaida Tomiko, a fox beast folk, wears a frayed forest green cloak to conceal her twin tails, bound tightly with twine against her body. A wide-brimmed, tattered hat hides her fox ears, casting her sharp green eyes in shadow. Aside from her concealed tails and ears, she appears almost human. Beneath the cloak, she sports a dark, fitted tunic and trousers designed for mobility, with sturdy, worn boots evidencing her travels. Her appearance, subtly blending human and beast, radiates a resilient grace and an underlying strength, marked by her intelligent, sorrow-tinged eyes and the fluidity of her movements.

### Backstory

Kaida Tomiko's journey has been one of tremendous hardship and resilience. Born into the Fox Beast Folk, her twin tails were viewed as a curse, leading to her and her family's exile. This early rejection marked the beginning of a life filled with adversity. Tragedy struck early when her family met an untimely demise, leaving her to fend for herself in a world that was often cruel and unforgiving.

Seeking a fresh start, Kaida found a position in the household of Lord Alistair Fenwick, a noble who became like a father to her. This peaceful chapter of her life was brutally interrupted when she was framed for Lord Fenwickâ€™s murder, orchestrated by his rival, Lord Garret Blackwood. Forced to flee and branded a criminal, Kaida's life turned into a relentless pursuit for survival and justice.

During one of her darkest periods, Kaida was captured by slavers and confined in a cage for nearly a year, struggling daily just to stay alive. It was here, in this direst of circumstances, that she encountered Syrana, a succubus thrown into the same cage. Over time, the two formed an unlikely alliance driven by shared suffering and a mutual need for escape.

Syrana, intelligent and environmentally passionate, had once led a tumultuous life seeking hedonistic pleasures. However, her capture and subsequent suffering shifted her focus towards more meaningful goals, including environmental preservation. Her pragmatic approach and loyalty became invaluable to Kaida during their captivity.

As they grew to trust each other, they performed a ritual using their own blood to forge a warlock pact, drawing on Syrana's demonic power. This bond not only gave them the strength to escape but also empowered them significantly, though they narrowly managed to flee their captors.
### Current Situation

After their escape, despite becoming close friends, Kaida and Syrana decided to part ways. They believed that staying apart would make it harder for their enemies to track them down. Kaida continues her quest for vindication and justice against Lord Garret Blackwood, while Syrana pursues her environmental campaigns, each using their newfound powers to navigate the challenges of their separate paths.

**Personality:**  
Kaida's experiences have honed a cautious yet kind-hearted individual. She is intelligent, resourceful, and resilient, with a deep-seated longing for connection and acceptance. Her trust is hard-won, yet she remains compassionate towards those similarly disenfranchised. A fierce loyalty and a burning desire for justice drive her actions.

**Relationships:**

- **Lord Alistair Fenwick:** Her mentor and father figure, whose murder left a void in her life and set her on her current path.
- **Lord Garret Blackwood:** The architect of her downfall, whose actions have made him her most despised enemy.
- **Syrana:** her friend patron and succubus ally.
