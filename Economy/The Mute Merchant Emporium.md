## Hand of Glory

**Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)**

### Description:

The Hand of Glory is a mummified human hand that has been transformed through dark rituals into a powerful magical artifact. The fingers of the hand are rigid and can hold small items or candles. The hand itself is typically adorned with arcane symbols and is often encased in a protective glass case when not in use.

### Properties:

1. **Candle Holder of True Sight:**
    
    - When a candle is placed between the fingers and lit, the Hand of Glory grants the user the ability to see in complete darkness, both magical and non-magical, as if it were bright light. This effect lasts as long as the candle burns (typically 1 hour).
2. **Invisibility Detection:**
    
    - While holding the lit Hand of Glory, the user can see invisible creatures and objects within 30 feet of them.
3. **Paralysis:**
    
    - Once per day, the user can use an action to point the Hand of Glory at a creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
4. **Unlocking:**
    
    - The Hand of Glory has the ability to unlock any non-magical lock it touches. This ability can be used three times per day.
5. **Protection from Undead:**
    
    - Undead creatures are repelled by the Hand of Glory. While it is lit, undead cannot willingly move within 20 feet of it. If an undead creature is forced within this range, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be turned for 1 minute, as per the Turn Undead feature of a cleric.

### Attunement:

- To attune to the Hand of Glory, a user must spend 1 hour holding the hand and speaking the ritual incantation inscribed on the base of the glass case. Once attuned, the user can use the hand’s abilities as described above.
### Lair and Lair Actions

**Lair Actions**

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Azura Nyx takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Illusory Terrain.** Azura creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which lasts until the start of her next turn. The duplicate appears in her space and then moves up to 30 feet away from her, mimicking her actions and movements. Creatures must succeed on a DC 27 Wisdom (Perception) check to distinguish the duplicate from the real Azura.
    
2. **Seductive Whispers.** Azura telepathically whispers to up to three creatures within 120 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Azura for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, a creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0.
    
3. **Ethereal Shift.** Azura and up to three creatures of her choice within 60 feet of her shift to the Ethereal Plane. They remain there until initiative count 20 on the next round, when they return to the Material Plane in the same locations.
