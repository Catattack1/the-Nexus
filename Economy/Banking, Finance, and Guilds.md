Banking and financial institutions play a crucial role in the economic landscape of the world. They not only safeguard wealth but also enable commerce, trade, and the accumulation of power.

    - **Loans and Credit**: Banks offer loans at interest rates that vary depending on the risk and the client’s status. Common folk might struggle to secure loans, while nobles and successful merchants can access substantial credit lines.
    - **Currency Exchange**: Banks provide currency exchange services, converting foreign or ancient currencies into local coinage at a fair rate.
