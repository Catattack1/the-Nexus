To convert these to D&D currency, let's establish a baseline. In many D&D settings, 1 gold piece (gp) is a significant amount, roughly equivalent to $100 in modern currency. This is a rough conversion and can be adjusted for your campaign. Here's how you might convert:

- 1 gp = $100
- 1 silver piece (sp) = $10
- 1 copper piece (cp) = $1
- 1 electrum piece (ep) = $50 (as it's often valued at half a gold piece)
- 1 platinum piece (pp) = $500 (commonly worth 10 gold pieces)
