### **Traits**

**Shapechanger (Changeling Form):** As an action, Lord Mercury can transform their appearance or revert to their natural form.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** Lord Mercury deals an extra 35 (10d6) damage when they hit a target with a finesse or ranged weapon attack if they have advantage or if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it.

**Cunning Action:** On each of their turns, Lord Mercury can use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

**Shadowy Escape (Recharge 5–6):** When hit by an attack, Lord Mercury teleports up to 60 feet to dim light or darkness, leaving a shadowy duplicate.

**Magical Ambush:** If hidden from a creature when casting a spell, the target has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell.

**Toxic Affliction:** Creatures within 30 feet of Lord Mercury who fail a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turns take 14 (4d6) poison damage and are poisoned until the end of their turn.

**Shadow Adept:** While in dim light or darkness, Lord Mercury has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Summoning Suppression:** Any spell or ability that would summon a creature (e.g., _Conjure Celestial_, _Find Greater Steed_, or _Summon Elemental_) fails automatically within 60 feet of Lord Mercury unless the caster succeeds on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. Summoned creatures within the radius are immediately banished (no save).

**Veil of Shadows (Anti-Scrying):** Any attempt to scry on Lord Mercury or his lair automatically fails unless the caster succeeds on a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw. Even on success, they can only see shadowy, indistinct shapes and hear faint whispers.

---

### **Legendary Actions** (3/Turn)

**Shadow Step (Costs 1 Action):** Lord Mercury teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space in dim light or darkness.

**Counter Summon (Costs 2 Actions):** Lord Mercury targets a summoning spell or ability being cast within 60 feet. The caster must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or the spell fails, consuming the spell slot.

**Glimpse of Shadows (Costs 3 Actions):** All creatures within 30 feet of Lord Mercury must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.

### **Regional Effects**

The region surrounding Lord Mercury's lair is twisted by his dark magic, extending up to 5 miles. These effects end 24 hours after Lord Mercury's death:

- **Anti-Scrying Aura:** Attempts to scry within this region automatically fail unless the caster succeeds on a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw. Even on success, images and sounds are distorted, providing no actionable information.
    
- **Shadows Come Alive:** Shadows within the region appear to move and writhe unnaturally. In dim light or darkness, creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw at the start of their turns or become frightened until the end of their next turn.
    
- **Suppressed Summoning:** Summoning spells and abilities within the region require a DC 19 Charisma saving throw to succeed. On failure, the spell or ability is wasted.
    
- **Faith Magic Suppression:** Divine spells (e.g., Cleric and Paladin spells) of 3rd level or higher require a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw to cast. On failure, the spell fizzles and the slot is wasted.

### **Mythic Form: Mercury Ascendant**

When Lord Mercury is reduced to 0 hit points, he transforms into **Mercury Ascendant**, gaining temporary hit points equal to **30**. Reality begins to crumble around him, unleashing devastating effects as he self-destructs.

**Traits in Mythic Form:**

- **Self-Destruction:** At the end of each of his turns, Mercury Ascendant takes 20 radiant damage that cannot be reduced or avoided.
- **Reality Crumbling:** At the start of each of his turns, roll a d6:
    - 1–2: A 30-foot cube of the terrain within 120 feet becomes difficult terrain and filled with shadowy tendrils. Any creature entering or starting its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.
    - 3–4: A rift opens, unleashing chaotic energy. Each creature within 15 feet of a rift must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6) radiant damage.
    - 5–6: Gravity destabilizes. Creatures within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of their next turn.

**Overload:** When Mercury Ascendant reaches 0 hit points, he explodes, forcing all creatures within a 120-foot radius to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 70 (20d6) fire damage and 70 (20d6) necrotic damage. On a success, they take half damage.
