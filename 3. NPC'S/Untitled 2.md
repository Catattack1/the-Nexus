### Ring of the Phoenix

_Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)_

#### Description:

The Ring of the Phoenix is a beautifully crafted ring made of an iridescent metal that seems to shimmer with all the colors of a sunrise. The band is adorned with intricate engravings of flames and feathers, symbolizing the mythical phoenix. At its center, a large, fiery-red gemstone pulses with a warm, inner light, reminiscent of a living ember.
