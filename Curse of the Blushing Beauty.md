### **Curse of the Blushing Beauty**

**Description:** The Curse of the Blushing Beauty is a mischievous and unpredictable enchantment that causes the affected individual to find themselves in perverted or embarrassing situations. These incidents often defy logic and physics, resulting in revealing positions or wardrobe malfunctions. The curse activates randomly and cannot be removed by normal means. It is hereditary and becomes more active based on the individual's perceived beauty by those around them.

**Effects:**

1. **Perverted Situations:**
    
    - The cursed individual frequently and unpredictably finds themselves in compromising and revealing situations. This can include tripping and falling in a manner that exposes them, clothing tearing or slipping off, and other similar incidents.
    - These situations often defy the laws of physics, with the individual somehow landing in positions that are both embarrassing and provocative.
2. **Wardrobe Malfunctions:**
    
    - The curse causes random wardrobe malfunctions, such as buttons popping, zippers breaking, or fabric tearing, often at the worst possible moments. These malfunctions lead to the exposure of undergarments or skin.
    - Clothing seems to be more fragile and prone to falling apart or slipping off, especially during moments of physical activity or when the individual is flustered.
3. **Random Activation:**
    
    - The curse activates unpredictably and cannot be anticipated. The frequency of activation increases with the number of people around who find the individual attractive. The more beautiful the individual is perceived to be, the more often the curse acts up.
    - Each time the individual is in a situation where their beauty is noticed or commented on, there is a chance the curse will activate.
4. **Hereditary Nature:**
    
    - The curse is passed down through bloodlines. If an individual with the curse has children, there is a high chance (75%) that the child will inherit the curse.
    - The curse grows stronger with each generation, making each descendant more susceptible to its effects.
5. **Irremovable by Normal Means:**
    
    - The curse cannot be removed by standard magical means such as _remove curse_. It requires a unique and complex ritual to lift, one that involves finding specific, rare components and performing a series of precise actions.
    - The ritual to remove the curse often involves facing and overcoming trials related to the individual's own sense of vanity and humility.

**Activation and Frequency:**

- The curse activates randomly, with no set interval between incidents. However, the likelihood of activation increases with the number of admirers or onlookers.
- The DM can roll a d100 to determine the probability of the curse activating during any given situation where the individual is the center of attention or is being admired.

**Role-Playing the Curse:**

- Characters afflicted by the Curse of the Blushing Beauty will find themselves in humorous, embarrassing, and often frustrating situations. This curse adds an element of unpredictability and comedy to the game.
- The character may become more self-conscious and wary of their surroundings, trying to avoid situations where the curse could activate.
- Friends and allies can offer support, whether by helping to repair clothing, providing cover, or assisting in finding a way to lift the curse.

**Example Incidents:**

1. **At a Royal Ball:** The cursed individual is dancing gracefully when they trip and fall, their dress tearing to reveal their petticoat.
2. **During Combat:** As they leap to attack, their pants rip, causing a momentary distraction to both friend and foe.
3. **Walking Through Town:** A gust of wind lifts their skirt or cloak, exposing more than intended and drawing the attention of passersby.

**Unique Ritual for Removal:**

- The ritual to remove the Curse of the Blushing Beauty requires the following:
    - A mirror forged from silver and enchanted under the light of a full moon.
    - The feather of a celestial bird, symbolizing purity and grace.
    - A flower that blooms only once a century, representing rare beauty.
    - A personal sacrifice that symbolizes humility and the willingness to let go of vanity.
- The individual must undertake a journey to gather these components and perform the ritual at a sacred site under specific conditions, reflecting their growth and acceptance of their inner and outer beauty.
