### The Unholy Trinity of Curses

**1. The Curse of Malevolent Fertility**

**Effects:**

- **Population Imbalance:** Females dominate the population, with approximately 99.01% females and only 0.99% males. Any female on the island, whether born there or merely visiting, has only a 1 in 101 chance of giving birth to a male child.
- **Lingering Curse:** The curse remains with any female who visits the island, ensuring that her chances of giving birth to a male child remain permanently reduced to 1 in 101, even if she leaves the island.
- **Unbreakable Bond:** Despite numerous attempts, the curse has proven unbreakable, and its requirements for lifting remain unknown.

**Backstory:** Millennia ago, the Circle of Shadows cast this powerful curse upon Elara to ensure the island's suffering and imbalance. Their intent was to disrupt the natural balance of life and observe the effects of a skewed gender ratio on the island's society.

**2. The Curse of Irresistible Homing**

**Effects:**

- **Compulsion to Stay:** Individuals who visit or are born on Elara feel an increasing compulsion to stay on the island. The longer they remain, the stronger the desire becomes, making it nearly impossible to leave.
- **Nostalgic Bond:** Those who manage to leave the island experience overwhelming feelings of nostalgia and longing for Elara, often leading them to return. This effect is more potent in those who have spent significant time on the island.
- **Psychological Anchor:** The curse subtly influences the mind, creating a sense of belonging and attachment to Elara. While individuals can resist with strong willpower, most find themselves drawn back to the island.

**Backstory:** The Malevolent Wizards designed this curse to ensure that Elara's population remains stable and attached to the island. By instilling a deep-seated compulsion to stay or return, they aimed to create a controlled and isolated environment for their experiments.
