# Kaida Tomiko
### Character Profile: Kaida Tomiko

**Race:** Fox Beast Folk  
**Appearance & Disguise** 

Kaida Tomiko is a figure shaped by adversity, her unique heritage, and a life on the run. Her defining feature, the twin tails that mark her as unique among fox beast folk, are bound tightly against her with twine, hidden beneath a cloak of deep forest green that's frayed at the edges from constant use. This cloak serves both as a practical garment for travel and as a means of concealment.

Her head is often shrouded beneath a wide-brimmed, tattered hat, coupled with a matching hood that serves to cast her sharp, green eyes into shadow, obscuring her face and the fox ears she presses down to blend in with the crowds. Despite these efforts at concealment, there's an inherent grace to her movements, a fluidity and poise that betray her beast folk heritage.

Underneath her cloak, Kaida wears a dark, fitted tunic and trousers, tailored for ease of movement and practicality. Her attire is designed not only for mobility but also for utility, with various pouches and tools attached to her belt, essentials for a life spent navigating the complexities of both wilderness and urban intrigue. Her boots are sturdy and worn, evidence of her constant travels and escapes.

Even with her ears hidden and her tails bound, Kaida's appearance is striking. Her piercing green eyes glint with intelligence and a hint of underlying sorrow, speaking volumes of her experiences and the resilience she's forged in response. Her hands, when visible, are often gloved, yet on rare occasions, they reveal the slight tapering characteristic of her race, adding to the mystique that surrounds her.

Kaida's appearance is a testament to her journey—a blend of her natural, striking features and the layers of disguise she's adopted for protection. Despite the shadows she's forced to inhabit, her inherent strength, resilience, and the unbreakable spirit of defiance against her unjust fate shine through, making her an unforgettable presence in the world of Eldoria.

**Background:**  
Once part of a tribe that viewed her twin tails as a curse, Kaida and her family were exiled, leading to a series of misfortunes that culminated in her family's demise. Seeking a new beginning, she found herself employed by Lord Alistair Fenwick, a noble who treated her more like a daughter than a servant. However, her peaceful existence was shattered when she was wrongfully accused of Lord Fenwick's murder, orchestrated by his rival, Lord Garret Blackwood. Branded a criminal and forced to flee, Kaida's life became a daily struggle for survival and vindication.

**Personality:**  
Kaida's experiences have honed a cautious yet kind-hearted individual. She is intelligent, resourceful, and resilient, with a deep-seated longing for connection and acceptance. Her trust is hard-won, yet she remains compassionate towards those similarly disenfranchised. A fierce loyalty and a burning desire for justice drive her actions.
