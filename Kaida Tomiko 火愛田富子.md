# Kaida Tomiko
### Character Profile: Kaida Tomiko

**Race:** Fox Beast Folk  
**Appearance & Disguise** 

Kaida Tomiko is a figure shaped by adversity, her unique heritage, and a life on the run. Her defining feature, the twin tails that mark her as unique among fox beast folk, are bound tightly against her with twine, hidden beneath a cloak of deep forest green that's frayed at the edges from constant use. This cloak serves both as a practical garment for travel and as a means of concealment.

Her head is often shrouded beneath a wide-brimmed, tattered hat, coupled with a matching hood that serves to cast her sharp, green eyes into shadow, obscuring her face and the fox ears she presses down to blend in with the crowds. Despite these efforts at concealment, there's an inherent grace to her movements, a fluidity and poise that betray her beast folk heritage.

Underneath her cloak, Kaida wears a dark, fitted tunic and trousers, tailored for ease of movement and practicality. Her attire is designed not only for mobility but also for utility, with various pouches and tools attached to her belt, essentials for a life spent navigating the complexities of both wilderness and urban intrigue. Her boots are sturdy and worn, evidence of her constant travels and escapes.

Even with her ears hidden and her tails bound, Kaida's appearance is striking. Her piercing green eyes glint with intelligence and a hint of underlying sorrow, speaking volumes of her experiences and the resilience she's forged in response. Her hands, when visible, are often gloved, yet on rare occasions, they reveal the slight tapering characteristic of her race, adding to the mystique that surrounds her.

Kaida's appearance is a testament to her journey—a blend of her natural, striking features and the layers of disguise she's adopted for protection. Despite the shadows she's forced to inhabit, her inherent strength, resilience, and the unbreakable spirit of defiance against her unjust fate shine through, making her an unforgettable presence in the world of Eldoria.

Full Name: **Kaida Tomiko 火愛田富子**

- **Kaida** (火愛田) - This can be broken down into kanji characters as follows: 火 (ka) meaning "fire," 愛 (ai) meaning "love," and 田 (da) meaning "rice paddy" or "field." The name "Kaida" is not traditionally Japanese and doesn't have a standard kanji representation, but for the purpose of creating a meaningful name that fits the character of a kitsune fox girl, these kanji can symbolize a fiery love or passion, akin to the spirited nature of a dragon, within the nurturing expanse of a field. This reflects the kitsune's fiery spirit and its ability to nourish the land and its people, similar to how dragons are often seen as guardians of treasures or natural elements in mythology.
    
- **Tomiko** (富子) - Tomiko combines 富 (Tomi) meaning "wealth" or "abundance," and 子 (ko) meaning "child." As a whole, Tomiko can be interpreted as "child of abundance," symbolizing prosperity, richness in life or spirit, and a benevolent nature.
    

**Meaning of the Full Name**: Kaida Tomiko, 火愛田富子, can be seen as symbolizing a being of fiery passion and love, nurtured within the vastness of nature, who brings prosperity and abundance to those around her.

### Backstory
Kaida Tomiko's journey has been one of tremendous hardship and resilience. Born into the Fox Beast Folk, her twin tails were viewed as a curse, leading to her and her family's exile. This early rejection marked the beginning of a life filled with adversity. Tragedy struck early when her family met an untimely demise, leaving her to fend for herself in a world that was often cruel and unforgiving. Seeking a fresh start, Kaida found a position in the household of Lord Alistair Fenwick, a noble who became like a father to her. This peaceful chapter of her life was brutally interrupted when she was framed for Lord Fenwick’s murder, orchestrated by his rival, Lord Garret Blackwood. Forced to flee and branded a criminal, Kaida's life turned into a relentless pursuit for survival and justice. During one of her darkest periods, Kaida was captured by slavers and confined in a cage for nearly a year, struggling daily just to stay alive. It was here, in this direst of circumstances, that she encountered Syrana, a succubus thrown into the same cage. Over time, the two formed an unlikely alliance driven by shared suffering and a mutual need for escape. Syrana, intelligent and environmentally passionate, had once led a tumultuous life seeking hedonistic pleasures. However, her capture and subsequent suffering shifted her focus towards more meaningful goals, including environmental preservation. Her pragmatic approach and loyalty became invaluable to Kaida during their captivity. As they grew to trust each other, they performed a ritual using their own blood to forge a warlock pact, drawing on Syrana's demonic power. This bond not only gave them the strength to escape but also empowered them significantly, though they narrowly managed to flee their captors.
### Character note quirks
often when voicing the character I typically add a slight Russian accent if I can manage it at the time and sometimes even speak in third person but it's not 100% consistent with that one
