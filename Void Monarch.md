### Traits

**Astral Dominion:** The Void Monarch can alter reality within its lair at will, creating or obliterating matter and life forms, altering the flow of time, or rewriting the laws of physics or magic.

**Void Genesis:** As a bonus action, the Void Monarch can create any creature of CR 20 or lower from the void. These creatures are fully loyal to the Monarch and remain for 24 hours or until dismissed.

**Multiversal Presence:** The Void Monarch exists in all planes simultaneously. It can act in up to three different planes during each of its turns.

**Infinite Shapeshift:** The Void Monarch can assume any form, combining abilities and traits from any number of creatures or entities at will.

### Actions

**Multiattack:** The Void Monarch makes 10 attacks with its Cosmic Tentacles or uses Devour Reality up to three times.

**Cosmic Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +24 to hit, reach 200 ft., one target. Hit: 120 (16d12 + 12) bludgeoning damage plus 60 (8d12) necrotic damage.

**Devour Reality:** Targets within 1,000 feet must succeed on a DC 32 Dexterity saving throw or take 300 (40d12) force damage, half on a successful save. If this reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is erased from existence.

**Universal Shift (Recharge 4-6):** The Void Monarch can alter the fundamental laws of the universe in a 1,000-foot radius for 1 minute. Effects are determined by the DM but can include reversing gravity, turning spells into sentient beings, or causing creatures to phase in and out of existence.

### Legendary Actions

The Void Monarch can take 6 legendary actions, choosing from the options below:

- **Cosmic Crush:** The Void Monarch causes a singularity to appear, drawing creatures within 500 feet towards it. Those who fail a DC 32 Strength save are pulled 100 feet towards the singularity and take 70 (10d12) bludgeoning damage.
- **Reality Warp:** The Void Monarch alters reality around up to three creatures it can see within 1,000 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 32 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as per the *wish* spell, at the DM's discretion.
- **Void Cascade (Costs 3 Actions):** The Void Monarch unleashes a wave of void energy in a 1,000-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a DC 32 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points, unless they are protected by a *wish* spell or similar power.

### Lair and Continental Effects

At this level, the Void Monarch's lair and continental effects would essentially allow it to terraform landscapes, create or dissolve dimensions at will, and dictate the very essence of reality within its realm. Entire campaigns could revolve around merely surviving the indirect effects of its presence or attempting to communicate with such a being to prevent or encourage cosmic-scale changes according to the narrative needs of the campaign.

Given this power level, the Void Monarch is less a creature and more a living event, the embodiment of the void and creation itself, challenging players to engage with the game on a metaph
