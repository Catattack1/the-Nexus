OK now let's continue on with another project of theirs that may and unintentionally reveal that they are a bit more promiscuous than they let on even though they're not really trying to hide it
Choker of Vocal Disguise
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

Description: This stylish choker is crafted from fine materials and features a small, unassuming gemstone at its center. It fits comfortably around the wearer's neck and adjusts magically to any neck size.

Properties: The Choker of Vocal Disguise allows the wearer to alter their voice. This change can include pitch, tone, accent, and even the apparent gender of the voice. The wearer can choose to sound like a child, an elderly person, or change between a masculine and a feminine voice, among other options.

Activation: The wearer activates the choker by holding the gemstone and thinking of the desired vocal qualities. The transformation of the voice is immediate and remains as long as the choker is worn.

Limitations:

The choker cannot replicate specific individuals' voices.
It is ineffective against magical means of detecting lies or determining a creature's true nature.
The effect is purely auditory and does not grant any abilities to influence others magically or enhance the wearer's persuasive abilities.
Deactivation: The wearer can revert to their natural voice at any time by simply willing the change, as long as they are wearing the choker. Removing the choker also immediately reverts the voice to its natural state.

Note: Prolonged use of the Choker of Vocal Disguise might lead to a temporary disassociation with one's natural voice, causing a mild identity disorientation upon deactivation. Regular users often find their voice to be 'strange' or 'foreign' for a brief period after removing the choker.
