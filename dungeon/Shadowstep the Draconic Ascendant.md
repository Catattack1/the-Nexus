**Draconic Heritage.** Shadowstep has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. She can speak Draconic and has advantage on all Charisma checks made to interact with dragons.

**Innate Spellcasting (Warlock).** Shadowstep can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks):

- At will: _Misty Step, Eldritch Blast, Mage Hand, Prestidigitation_
- 1/day each: _Dimension Door, Greater Invisibility, Chain Lightning, Fireball_

**Keen Smell.** Shadowstep has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Shadow Teleport.** As a bonus action, Shadowstep can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving a trail of shadows. She cannot use this ability again until she finishes a short or long rest.

**Dragon’s Wings.** Shadowstep gains a flying speed of 60 feet.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Shadowstep's choice within 60 feet of her and aware of her must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Shadowstep's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Multiattack.** Shadowstep can make three attacks: one with her claws and two with her shadow tendrils or draconic breath.

### **Actions**

**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.

**Shadow Tendrils.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d6 + 6) necrotic damage.

**Draconic Breath (Recharge 5–6).** Shadowstep exhales a 30-foot cone of frost and shadow. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold and necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Surprise Pounce.** If Shadowstep teleports within 5 feet of a creature and hits it with a claws attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Dragon's Fury.** As an action, Shadowstep can let out a terrifying roar, unleashing a burst of shadow and draconic magic. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 27 (6d8) force damage and are blinded until the end of Shadowstep's next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not blinded.

**Healing Light (Celestial Patron).** Shadowstep has a pool of d6s that she can spend to heal a creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The number of dice in the pool equals 12. As a bonus action, she can heal one creature she can see within 60 feet of her, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice she can spend at once equals her Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice she spends; the target regains a number of hit points equal to the total rolled.

### **Reactions**

**Draconic Shield.** When Shadowstep takes damage from a spell, she can use her reaction to gain resistance to that spell’s damage type until the end of her next turn.

**Hydra's Resilience.** Whenever Shadowstep takes damage, she can use her reaction to summon an additional shadow tendril, up to a maximum of 4 tendrils. Each tendril has its own hit points (5 each) and can be attacked separately.

### **Legendary Actions**

Shadowstep can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Shadowstep regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

- **Attack.** Shadowstep makes a shadow tendril attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Shadowstep beats her wings. Each creature within 15 feet of her must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Shadowstep can then fly up to half her flying speed.
- **Shadow Step.** Shadowstep uses her Shadow Teleport ability.
