### Air Puzzle: Whispers of the Wind

### Fire Puzzle: The Eternal Flame's Riddle

- **Room Description**: This room has a central brazier with an 'eternal flame'. Around the room are several unlit torches with symbols.
- **Puzzle Mechanism**: Players must light the torches in a specific order to unlock the door.
- **Clue**: An inscription by the flame: "To walk my path, ignite first the lifebringer, then the destroyer, followed by the purifier, and lastly the beacon in darkness."

### Water Puzzle: Flow of Knowledge

- **Room Description**: A room with a series of interconnected basins filled with water, and a dry fountain in the center.
- **Puzzle Mechanism**: Players need to redirect the flow of water to get the central fountain flowing.
- **Task**: Each basin can tilt or rotate to change the water's flow. The correct configuration is hinted at through a series of pictograms on the walls.
- **Solution**: The pictograms depict a cycle of rain (collecting in mountains, flowing through rivers, nourishing fields, and returning to the sea). Players must align the basins to mimic this cycle, activating the fountain.

Completing all four puzzles causes the main door to unlock, perhaps accompanied by an elemental display symbolizing the harmony achieved by solving the puzzles. This approach not only challenges the players' problem-solving skills but also immerses them in the thematic elements of earth, air, fire, and water.
