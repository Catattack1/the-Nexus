### Room Description

- **Visuals**: The room is a lush, vibrant indoor garden, overflowing with a variety of plants, herbs, and flowers, each meticulously labeled. The air is fragrant with a mix of earthy and floral scents.
- **Layout**: Central pathways wind through the garden, leading to a large, ancient cauldron set on a stone pedestal in the heart of the room. Shelves with gardening tools, mortar and pestle, and empty vials are scattered around the edges.

### Puzzle Mechanism

- **Herb Interaction**: Each plant has unique properties (healing, toxic, hallucinogenic, etc.), and the labels provide both the name and a brief description.
- **Cauldron**: The cauldron is enchanted to react when the correct combination of herbs is added, changing color, emitting sounds, or producing scents to indicate correctness.

### Objective

- **Potion Brewing**: To unlock the exit, players must brew a specific potion. The recipe for this potion is not straightforward and requires interpretation.

### Hint System

- **Riddles on the Walls**: The garden walls are covered in riddles that describe the effects and uses of various herbs without naming them directly. For example, "From the sleepless night, seek the leaf that brings rest, and mix it with the tears of the sun."
- **Herb Properties**: Players must use their knowledge or deduction skills to match the riddlesâ€™ descriptions to the properties of the herbs.

### Additional Layers

- **Herb Identification Challenge**: Some herbs might look similar, adding a layer of difficulty in identifying the correct ones.
- **Variable Recipes**: Different riddles could lead to different valid potions, allowing multiple solutions.
- **Time Sensitivity**: Certain ingredients might need to be added in a specific order or within a certain time frame after being picked.

### Consequences and Rewards

- **Success**: Upon successfully brewing the potion, the cauldron emits a radiant light, and the exit door slowly opens, possibly releasing a pleasant, rejuvenating aroma.
- **Mistakes**: Incorrect combinations could result in harmless but amusing effects, such as a puff of smoke in funny shapes or a temporary change in hair color for the players.

### Potion Recipe
- **step one**:From Luna's Silver Garden, pluck the bloom that glows, where dreams are king and restfulness flows.
- **step two**:Seek the fire that never burns, in a tulip's embrace, where the sun's own child yearns.
- **step three**:In the whispering green, find the herb that remembers, where time stands still and the past embers.
- **step four**:Beneath the star's watchful eye, grasp the blade that glistens, where truth lies hidden and the mind listens.
- **step five**:Lastly, seek the phoenix's feathered grace, where life renews and finds its place.
- **step six**:Stir thrice with a wand kissed by the moon, under the gaze of the night's silent tune.
