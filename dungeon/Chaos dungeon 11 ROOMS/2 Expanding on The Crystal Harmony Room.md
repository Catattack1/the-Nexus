### Room Description

- **Visuals**: The room glimmers with an array of crystals embedded in the walls and ceiling. Each crystal is a different hue â€“ deep blues, vibrant reds, earthy greens, and sunny yellows, all softly illuminated from within.
- **Layout**: The crystals are arranged in clusters that suggest they are part of a larger, interconnected system. Some crystals are larger and more prominent, indicating their significance.

### Puzzle Mechanism

- **Interaction**: When a player touches a crystal, it emits a musical note. The pitch and tone of the note depend on the crystal's size and color.
- **Variety**: Each cluster of crystals produces a distinct range of notes, similar to musical octaves. Players can experiment with combinations to produce different sounds.

### Objective

- **Melody Replication**: To unlock the door, players must replicate a specific melody. This melody is complex enough to require a sequence of notes from different clusters.
- **Collaboration**: The task is designed so that no single player can reach all the necessary crystals at once, encouraging teamwork.

### Hint System

- **Written Riddle**: A poem engraved on a plaque that metaphorically describes the melody. For example, "A dance of light on still waters, a soft breeze through autumn leaves, the calm before a gentle rain, and the whisper of twilight."
- **Auditory Clue**: As the players enter, the crystals briefly and faintly play the melody. This might only occur once, or it might repeat at intervals.

### Additional Challenges

- **Timed Sequence**: Players might have to replicate the melody within a certain time limit, adding a sense of urgency.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The first few notes of the melody might be easy to replicate, but it becomes increasingly complex.
- **Environmental Effects**: The room could subtly change as players interact with the crystals (e.g., colors shift, the room vibrates gently), adding to the immersive experience.

### Reward and Consequence

- **Success**: Upon successful replication, the crystals glow brightly, and the door slowly opens, possibly accompanied by a harmonious chime.
- **Failure**: If players fail, they might trigger a mild, non-lethal setback (e.g., a brief dissonance sound causing disorientation, temporary dimming of lights in the room).
