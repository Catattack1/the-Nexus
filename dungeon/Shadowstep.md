**Actions**

**Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage.

**Shadow Tendrils.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) necrotic damage.

**Surprise Pounce.** If Shadowstep teleports within 5 feet of a creature and hits it with a claws attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Hydra's Resilience.** Whenever Shadowstep takes damage, she can use her reaction to summon an additional shadow tendril, up to a maximum of 4 tendrils. Each tendril has its own hit points (5 each) and can be attacked separately.

**Shadow Regeneration.** At the start of her turn, if Shadowstep has fewer than 4 shadow tendrils, she regrows one tendril. Additionally, each shadow tendril can regenerate 1 hit point at the start of her turn if it has at least 1 hit point remaining.

**Shadow Whip.** Shadowstep can use her shadow tendrils to grapple and restrain targets. A creature hit by a shadow tendril must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 16). While grappled in this way, the creature is restrained, and Shadowstep cannot use the same tendril to attack another target.

**Shadow Burst.** As an action, Shadowstep can cause all her shadow tendrils to explode with shadowy energy. Each creature within 10 feet of her must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After using this ability, Shadowstep loses all her shadow tendrils and cannot summon new ones until she finishes a short or long rest.

**Shadow Step.** Shadowstep can use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving a trail of shadows. She can bring along any shadow tendrils she has summoned, and they reappear with her at the destination.

**Healing Light (Celestial Patron).** Shadowstep has a pool of d6s that she can spend to heal a creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The number of dice in the pool equals 8. As a bonus action, she can heal one creature she can see within 60 feet of her, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice she can spend at once equals her Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice she spends; the target regains a number of hit points equal to the total rolled.
