## **1. Standard Currencies**

In this world, the economy is primarily based on a standardized currency system that includes four main types of coins. Each type of coin is made from a different material and holds a distinct value.

### **Copper Pieces (cp)**

- **Value**: The most common and least valuable currency.
- **Usage**: Used for everyday, low-cost transactions such as buying basic food, drink, or simple tools.
- **Appearance**: Small and often tarnished, these coins bear the symbol of the realm or ruling power.

### **Silver Pieces (sp)**

- **Value**: 10 cp = 1 sp
- **Usage**: Used for mid-range transactions, such as lodging, meals at an inn, or purchasing simple weapons and equipment.
- **Appearance**: Slightly larger than copper coins, with a brighter sheen and intricate designs.

### **Gold Pieces (gp)**

- **Value**: 10 sp = 1 gp or 100 cp = 1 gp
- **Usage**: The standard currency for most adventurers, gold is used for expensive purchases, including magical items, high-quality weapons, and armor.
- **Appearance**: Shiny and meticulously crafted, often with the likeness of a ruler or deity.

### **Platinum Pieces (pp)**

- **Value**: 10 gp = 1 pp or 1,000 cp = 1 pp
- **Usage**: Rare and highly valuable, platinum coins are used for significant transactions, such as buying property, commissioning custom magical items, or paying large debts.
- **Appearance**: Larger and heavier than gold coins, these are often inscribed with elaborate designs or symbols of great power.

## **2. Exchange Rates**

The following exchange rates apply to the standard currencies:

- **1 Platinum Piece (pp) = 10 Gold Pieces (gp)**
- **1 Gold Piece (gp) = 10 Silver Pieces (sp)**
- **1 Silver Piece (sp) = 10 Copper Pieces (cp)**
- **1 Platinum Piece (pp) = 100 Silver Pieces (sp)**
- **1 Platinum Piece (pp) = 1,000 Copper Pieces (cp)**

## **3. Non-Standard Currency**

In addition to the standard currencies, other forms of currency exist, though they are less common and often vary in value depending on the region or circumstances.

### **Gems and Precious Stones**

- Often used in barter or as a portable form of wealth.
- Value varies based on type, size, and quality.
- Can be exchanged for standard currency or used in trade.

### **Foreign Currency**

- Coins from distant lands or ancient civilizations.
- May have different exchange rates depending on local acceptance and value.
- Can be used in specific regions or traded with collectors and merchants.

### **Barter System**

- Goods and services are sometimes exchanged directly, especially in remote or isolated areas where standard currency is scarce.
- The value is negotiable and often dependent on local demand and availability.
