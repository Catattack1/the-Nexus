1. **Soul Echo**: The necromancer can temporarily capture the echoes of souls that have recently departed. This ability allows the necromancer to summon a spectral version of a fallen enemy or ally for a short duration. The spectral version has a fraction of the original's strength and can perform one action before dissipating. This could be an attack, a spell, or a special move that the original could perform.
    
2. **Bonecraft**: The necromancer can manipulate bones to create various objects or constructs, such as armor, weapons, or barriers. These creations are temporary and have limited durability but provide versatility in combat and utility situations. For example, creating a bone shield for defense or a bone spear for a ranged attack.
    
3. **Life Leech**: This ability allows the necromancer to drain a small amount of life force from enemies around them, converting it into a minor healing effect for themselves or their allies. It's not very powerful but can be crucial for sustainability in prolonged engagements.
    
4. **Shadow Step**: The necromancer can step into the shadow realm for a brief moment, allowing them to pass through obstacles or enemies and reappear a short distance away. This ability is perfect for repositioning, escaping tight situations, or setting up attacks from unexpected angles.
    
5. **Ghostly Chains**: The necromancer can summon ethereal chains that bind and immobilize an enemy for a short time. While the target is bound, they are slightly more susceptible to damage. This ability is great for crowd control and setting up combos with allies.
    
6. **Necrotic Empowerment**: The necromancer can sacrifice a portion of their health to temporarily increase their magical power. This risky maneuver can turn the tide of battle by significantly enhancing the necromancer's spells but at the cost of making them more vulnerable.
    
7. **Grave Silence**: The necromancer emits an aura of silence, preventing enemies within a small radius from using their abilities for a few seconds. This ability disrupts enemy strategies and gives the necromancer and their allies an upper hand in fights.
    
8. **Summon Plaguebearer**: The necromancer can summon a small, weak minion that carries a contagious plague. If the plaguebearer hits an enemy, it inflicts a damage-over-time effect that can spread to nearby enemies if they get too close. The minion is fragile and easy to kill but can be used strategically to pressure enemies and control space.
    
9. **Death's Door**: When an ally is about to receive a fatal blow, the necromancer can temporarily delay their death, giving them a few extra seconds of action before succumbing. This can allow the dying ally to perform a last act of defiance, whether it's casting a final spell, escaping, or delivering a crucial message.
    
10. **Wraith's Whisper**: The necromancer can communicate with the spirits of the dead to gain insights, revealing hidden traps, treasures, or even getting hints on solving puzzles. This ability doesn't have a direct combat application but greatly enhances the necromancer's utility in exploration and problem-solving.
