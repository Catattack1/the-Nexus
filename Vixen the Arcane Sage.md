**Spellcasting.** Vixen is a 20th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following wizard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** Fire Bolt, Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, Prestidigitation, Ray of Frost, Shocking Grasp  
**1st level   (4 slots):** Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Shield, Detect Magic  
**2nd level (3 slots):** Misty Step, Scorching Ray, Mirror Image  
**3rd level (3 slots):** Counterspell, Fireball, Fly  
**4th level (3 slots):** Dimension Door, Greater Invisibility, Polymorph  
**5th level (3 slots):** Cone of Cold, Teleportation Circle, Wall of Force  
**6th level (2 slots):** Chain Lightning, Globe of Invulnerability  
**7th level (2 slots):** Forcecage, Teleport  
**8th level (1 slot):** Mind Blank, Power Word Stun  
**9th level (1 slot):** Time Stop, Meteor Swarm

**Arcane Recovery (1/Day).** Once per day when Vixen finishes a short rest, she can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than 10, and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Vixen fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Arcane Ward.** Vixen has an Arcane Ward that protects her. When she casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, she can simultaneously use a strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on herself that lasts until she finishes a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice her wizard level + her Intelligence modifier. Whenever Vixen takes damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, Vixen takes any remaining damage. While the ward has 0 hit points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic remains. Whenever Vixen casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.

**Actions:**

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.

**Reactions:**

**Shield (1st-Level Spell; 1 Reaction).** When Vixen is hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell, she can use her reaction to cast Shield, adding +5 to her AC until the start of her next turn, including against the triggering attack.

**Counterspell (3rd-Level Spell; 1 Reaction).** When Vixen sees a creature within 60 feet of her casting a spell, she can use her reaction to attempt to interrupt the spellcasting. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, Vixen makes an ability check using her spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.

**Legendary Actions (3/Turn):** Vixen can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Vixen regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

- **Cantrip.** Vixen casts a cantrip.
- **Teleport.** Vixen magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.
- **Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Vixen casts a 1st-3rd level spell she has prepared.
