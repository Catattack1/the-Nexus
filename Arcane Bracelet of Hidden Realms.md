## Arcane Bracelet of Hidden Realms

**Item Type**: Wondrous item (bracelet)  
**Rarity**: Legendary  
**Attunement**: Required

This exquisite bracelet features a dual-colored gemstone embedded in a finely wrought silver band. The gemstone flickers with a mysterious inner light, swirling with shadows and luminescence that seem to hint at other worlds.

### Magic Properties:

- **Dimensional Mastery**: The bracelet grants the wearer the ability to manipulate spatial dimensions in several ways:
    - **Demiplane**: Once per long rest, the wearer can cast the _Demiplane_ spell without using a spell slot. When activated, the gemstone turns completely black, as if absorbing all surrounding light.
    - **Arcane Gate**: The wearer can cast _Arcane Gate_ twice per long rest. Upon casting, one color of the gem glows brightly.
    - **Dimension Door**: The wearer can cast _Dimension Door_ three times per long rest. The other color in the gem pulses with a gentle light when this ability is used.

### Curse:

Once the bracelet is put on, it cannot be removed except by the effects of a _Remove Curse_ spell or similar magic. If attempted to be forcibly removed, the bracelet tightens imperceptibly, and the gemstone flashes a warning red hue.
